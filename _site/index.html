    							<p>I like games that give me tools and let me decide how to use them. Games with emergent, interconnected systems that reward exploration and experimentation. Games that blend the static and scripted with the systemic and emergent such that the world feels reactive and alive with possibilities. Games where everything you do is a choice.</p>

<p>Deux Ex games take these mechanics and intertwine them with narratives of espionage and global conspiracy, filled with major and minor characters with diverse motivations, goals and loyalties, and leave you free to find your own place and role in their world.</p>

<p>Mankind Divided is the most successful game at doing all of that since the original Deus Ex.</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>Steamworld Dig was a gem of a game that felt like a nice relaxing holiday amongst all the rougelite action platformy games — it was nice to play an explorative platformer that didn’t feel like it wanted to <em>punish</em> me at every turn. It was casual in all the right ways without being at all bland. It knew what it wanted to be and had the confidence to just be it.</p>

<p>Steamworld Dig 2 takes everything I loved in the first game and makes it better.</p>

<div class="byline">by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRE3NFNtdjR96-H4QG4U1Fg">HexDSL</a> on June 27, 2017</div>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>Systemd has a cool thing called nspawn which is a mechanism for running things in containers. The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn">Arch Wiki</a> puts it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a light-weight namespace container. It is more powerful than chroot since it fully virtualizes the file system hierarchy, as well as the process tree, the various IPC subsystems and the host and domain name.</p>

  <p>systemd-nspawn limits access to various kernel interfaces in the container to read-only, such as /sys, /proc/sys or /sys/fs/selinux. Network interfaces and the system clock may not be changed from within the container. Device nodes may not be created. The host system cannot be rebooted and kernel modules may not be loaded from within the container.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will tell the tale of how I created a container in which to run Steam (and other things).</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>Night in the Woods is a (largely-)linear-narrative explorationy adventure game — very much not the sort of thing I usually enjoy — but the preview material for this game intrigued me enough to try it and I’m <em>so</em> glad that I did.</p>

<p>It’s really special.</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a real-time tactics game in the vein of Commandos and Desperados, a genre that’s really gone neglected since the early 00s.</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>The Dwarves is a narrative RPG with interesting real-time pauseable combat mechanics. The game’s marketing has tried really hard to sell this as an all-out action RPG and I think that’s a shame since it’s really not. And what it actually <em>is</em> is far more interesting than that.</p>

    							<p>Meadow is a sedate game about exploration, co-operation and non-verbal communication. It’s a multi-user wilderness in which you take on the role of an animal cub and, along with others, work out what the world is about. Here’s the story of my first couple of hours.</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>GoNNER is a somewhat-roguelike action platformer with a <em>sumptuously gorgeous</em> aesthetic. It’s also pretty hard — I’m not really very good at platformers or side-scrolling games in general — so I’ve not yet got beyond world two. I believe it’s a fairly short game but I wouldn’t know for sure because <em>I keep dying</em>. But having a lot of <strong>fun</strong> doing so.</p>

    							<p>I’ve got a lot of hours in Rocket League and, while I’m not actually very <em>good</em>, I <em>am</em> very <em>experienced</em>. So I thought I’d share what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>This is not going to be about how to improve your technical skill — the way to do that is to <em>practise</em> lots by playing games and doing training. This is going to be about how to play well as a member of a team and will pertain mainly to 3 vs. 3, since that’s what I play.</p>

<div class="byline">by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRE3NFNtdjR96-H4QG4U1Fg">HexDSL</a> on September 16, 2016</div>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>I’d had my eye on 5089 and its forebears, 3089 and 4089, for the longest time but never got around to giving them a go. I was wary — they <em>sounded</em> like exactly my kind of game but the rudimentary graphics were off-putting (crude graphics aren’t a problem in themselves — if the game is good I don’t care — but they sometimes evince a more general lack of care)  and I found it hard to believe that these games, made by a lone developer, could live up to their descriptions.</p>

<p>I spotted 5089 on sale the other day and decided to take the plunge. So, <em>does</em> it live up to its description?</p>
