   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like games that give me tools and let me decide how to use them. Games with emergent, interconnected systems that reward exploration and experimentation. Games that blend the static and scripted with the systemic and emergent such that the world feels reactive and alive with possibilities. Games where everything you do is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deux Ex games take these mechanics and intertwine them with narratives of espionage and global conspiracy, filled with major and minor characters with diverse motivations, goals and loyalties, and leave you free to find your own place and role in their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind Divided is the most successful game at doing all of that since the original Deus Ex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human Revolution, until the final catastrophe, presented a world full of hope for the bourgeoning possibilities of augmentation and self-directed evolution. Inequality was present but treated as a fixable problem by the game’s more thinky characters. The general spirit was one of optimism and of being on the brink of a new Renaissance — a period the game’s aesthetic design pillaged expertly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind Divided is a distinctly post-catastrophe world where Augs (augmented humans) are, due to distrust and fear (and the usual opportunism), treated very much as second-class citizens, if citizens at all — routinely brutalised by the police and other citizens, segregated and even shipped off to what are internment camps in all but name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renaissance design influences are gone — no more ruffed collars, sadly — and replaced with a far more run-down, dirty aesthetic where environments feel quite brutalist with their rectilinear forms and big, chunky, square columns — reminiscent of the low poly, shiny-floored solidity of interiors in the original game. The architecture and urban spaces no longer speak of the hope of a bright future, now they dominate with austere oppressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_lights.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_lights.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the game’s chosen aesthetic is less inherently &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; than that of Human Revolution, the designers have done, if anything, an even better job of creating a beautiful, if stark, world. Even in some of the ugliest areas of the game — the Aug ghetto you visit, for example — the game’s environments are often stunning. Whether in the beautiful chaos of the tangled wires the world relies on for its information feeds or places where humans have tried to beautify their drab surroundings with light and colour, the game often stuns with its attention to the mise-en-scène.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_wires.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_wires.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind Divided tells a smaller story than any of the previous titles, focussing on a world very much going to shit. For people like me who love the original game this is &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt;; we get to see the unfolding of events which will, eventually (hopefully in a later game), lead to Silhouette’s bombing of the Statue of Liberty and the founding of UNATCO. We also get to see big names we recognise from Deus Ex vying for position and orchestrating and reacting to events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game only has one hub — something which has been criticised but, to my mind, perfectly suits the purpose and character of the game. The enshittening of the world is told through the eyes of the city of Prague and its people. There are, of course, missions to other locations, but it’s Prague to which we keep returning and through which we witness rising tensions between Augs and ‘Naturals’ and the increasing hostility and, later, brutality of the police. Prague serves as focus and flashpoint for events of global significance. It’s a portrait of a world falling apart with Prague as the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way XP is distributed has been rebalanced since Human Revolution which is a change for the better — it was the wrong way to be opinionated about player choices in a Deus Ex game. Weapons now seem less powerful, at least early on, which is a much better means of nudging players towards a more stealthy, less violent approach. Similarly, hacking tasks now reward more fairly based on goals rather than methods — you get XP regardless of whether you hacked a thing or found the code in the world. There are also &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; fewer unimportant computers to hack which is a blessing for those of us who find XP hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_mech.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_mech.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the hacking mini-game still exists. It’s a fine game in and of itself; just a very different activity to the rest of the game, which breaks immersion and the natural rhythm of fun infiltration action and exploration. It’s also irritatingly luck-based. The hacking in the original Deus Ex, which was just a progress bar, may not have been interactive, but waiting for the hacking bar to fill up created time pressure and tension without taking the player &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the game they were enjoying. It’s not a big deal, I just wish the devs had found a cleverer way to keep hacking active without breaking the game’s flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level design is improved since Human Revolution with explorable spaces feeling simultaneously more natural and more labyrinthine. Finding alternate routes feels like a logical process rather than merely stumbling on Route B. Back doors &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;back doors&lt;/em&gt; rather than just… &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; doors, as they sometimes did in the previous game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infiltration is, of course, the meat of the game and the area where player choice has the most immediate impact. A stealthy, pacifistic run feels very different from an all-guns-blazing approach, which feels different again from taking everyone down without being seen. I took the latter approach during my first play-through, playing quite carefully and thoroughly, treating levels like real-time puzzle games as I worked out how to use my various tools to get &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; without ever being seen. I’m now playing new game plus mode (you keep your augmentations and gear) in a far more gung-ho fashion and it feels very different — the approach you take completely changes the function of the environments you’re navigating and thus how they feel as levels. Despite the thoroughness of my first play-through I’m finding plenty I missed including at least one major side-quest line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A welcome change over Human Revolution is the return of having to choose between augmentations. Early in the game Adam discovers that alongside his regular, Sarif-supplied augmentations he seems to have a raft of super secret extra mega cool augmentations from a mystery source. Activating these augs, however, requires the de-activation of a regular augmentation, for at least some of the game. I wish that it were for all of the game — choice is key to Deus Ex and being forced to make difficult strategic choices between augmentations adds weight and tactical depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_stairs.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_stairs.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-quests and main quests interweave more closely than they did in Human Revolution with core narrative content often being found in the side-missions. There’s also &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more contextual narrative in the various books, magazines, newspapers, data pads and emails than in any of the previous games, much of it providing a tantalising look into the shaping of the J.C. Denton era world. For people who’ve played the original game there’s a wealth of rewarding reading in Mankind Divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-quest givers and other named NPCs now seem more situated in their place and circumstances. I really got a sense that these are people — from activists to police officers to Aug refugees and Naturals — each trying to survive in a world on the brink of collapse. Some give in to the anti-aug sentiment gleefully, others reluctantly. Some resist, others give up. Some try to profit from the misery while others attempt to cling to their morality. The array of reactions each feel real, personal and specific to that person’s circumstances and story and reflect the changes they see in the world around them as time passes in the game (spoiler: shit gets worse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_50.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mankind_divided_50.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it still has the bombastic conspiracy stuff we know and love Deus Ex for, Mankind Divided finds a space in its world to tell very human stories that I found quite affecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side-quests are as diverse as the people giving them — work for a mob boss, find a serial killer, help a couple of refugees acquire fake documents, reacquaint with old artificial friends — and all help tell the story of a world undergoing profound change and the people trying to cope with that change. More successfully than in any other Deus Ex game, you get to see the &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; of the world-shaking events within which Jensen is enmeshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a smaller, more focussed story than its predecessor, Mankind Divided is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; game. My first (careful) play-through took 60 hours and I’m already deep into my second. The focus on Prague allows the game to illustrate the changes happening to the world — the sense of something pent-up and about to burst. The anger and fear and the humane and inhumane reactions of characters both noble and base. A world about to explode seen through the experiences of one city with Adam as witness both to great events and the lives those events touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the Deus Ex we all love — breaking into things and sneaking around and knocking people out and hacking all their secrets — but it feels like a more emotionally rich and &lt;em&gt;grown up&lt;/em&gt; game than Deus Ex has managed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One caveat&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a &lt;em&gt;demanding&lt;/em&gt; game. Playing on very high settings I got about 30-50 fps in most areas with my recent i7 and GTX 1070. I hear from my filthy Windows-using friends that it’s about the same on their stupid OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another caveat&lt;/strong&gt;: The game got some poor reviews, especially community reviews, on release because of its &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; micro-transactions. That stuff is all either rectified or ignorable. I’ve played a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of this game and never felt affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got the PC to run it I’d &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommend Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, especially to fans of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/337000/Deus_Ex_Mankind_Divided/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/deus-ex-mankind-divided&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Steamworld Dig 2</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/steamworld-dig-2/"/>
   <updated>2017-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/steamworld-dig-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Steamworld Dig was a gem of a game that felt like a nice relaxing holiday amongst all the rougelite action platformy games — it was nice to play an explorative platformer that didn’t feel like it wanted to &lt;em&gt;punish&lt;/em&gt; me at every turn. It was casual in all the right ways without being at all bland. It knew what it wanted to be and had the confidence to just be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steamworld Dig 2 takes everything I loved in the first game and makes it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freed from the desire to punish the player, Steamworld Dig 2, like its predecessor, hands you a bunch of tools and a playground and says: Go and have fun! Try things out and see what happens! &lt;em&gt;Explore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_town.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_town.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has a narrative and it’s lovely, helping the game feel like a journey rather than &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; exploration of an environment — but it’s not &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you play. It’s a sandboxy open-world feeling game about seeing what’s round the next corner (and mining it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You play as Dorothy, a steambot who’s decided to go looking for her pal Rusty, the protagonist of the first game. This involves going down into mines, mining stuff, finding caves and exploring them, gaining new tools, going back to town and selling what you mined, upgrading your tools and going mining again, much as Rusty did. Everything about it is improved over the first game, though — the tools are better, the caves are puzzlier, the upgrade system is far more fleshed out and the game is less linear and a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all of the improvements the few rough edges have been smoothed away, too. For example, health is now replenished when you go back to town rather than having to pay to top up, and filling your water tank no longer depletes water pools. Those things added nothing to the game so they were dropped. The devs really have shown uncommon good sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_top.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_top.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than one largely linear mine/cave we now have a series of interconnected mines/caves/areas which can pretty much be explored freely — the narrative guides the player but doesn’t restrict them. You can explore as much as you like looking for secrets (of which there are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt;) and trying to find every cog to upgrade your tools, or you can just go where the narrative wants you to go; it’s entirely up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caves are great now. They’re small self-contained levels within the broader level which usually take the form of a little puzzle. And they’re &lt;em&gt;really good puzzles&lt;/em&gt; — they’re not just &lt;em&gt;press the switch to open the thing&lt;/em&gt; — some of them really had me thinking hard. While in a puzzle cave you’re free to try things out without risk of losing the resources you’re carrying — dying just results in a reset at the start of the cave — which allows a proper crack at solving the puzzle without the anxiety of losing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_temple.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/steamworld_dig_2_temple.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a relaxing, &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; game to play. There’s something interesting around every corner whether a new environment, a fun little puzzle, a challenging encounter or just resources to gather. It’s easy to get lost in and end up playing for hours and hours. It’s a delightful game that manages to be cute without being twee, funny without being silly, relaxing without being boring, casual while still challenging, and it feels free and open without being confusing or overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steamworld Dig 2 feels like the product of a very clear-sighted group of people who knew exactly what they wanted to make and made exactly that. It’s the gem of Steamworld Dig polished until it gleams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy it in all the usual places: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/steamworld_dig_2&quot;&gt;gog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/steamworld-dig-2&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/571310/SteamWorld_Dig_2/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a minuteish of random gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Running Steam in a systemd-nspawn Container</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Nspawn-Steam-Container/"/>
   <updated>2017-06-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Nspawn-Steam-Container</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Systemd has a cool thing called nspawn which is a mechanism for running things in containers. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn&quot;&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; puts it thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a light-weight namespace container. It is more powerful than chroot since it fully virtualizes the file system hierarchy, as well as the process tree, the various IPC subsystems and the host and domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;systemd-nspawn limits access to various kernel interfaces in the container to read-only, such as /sys, /proc/sys or /sys/fs/selinux. Network interfaces and the system clock may not be changed from within the container. Device nodes may not be created. The host system cannot be rebooted and kernel modules may not be loaded from within the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will tell the tale of how I created a container in which to run Steam (and other things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here are &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s fun playing with things Linux can do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To rid my host system of those irritating 32 bit libraries and have a pure 64 bit (host) system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To isolate proprietary software (Nvidia drivers aside) from the rest of the system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To prevent Steam and games from spewing clutter into /home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the most technical person in the world, I may have not done everything in the ideal way. All I can say for sure is: I got it working and here’s how. I welcome corrections and improvements (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/LudicLinux/LudicLinux.github.io&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;, ideally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be specific to Arch Linux, pulseaudio and the Nvidia proprietary drivers because that’s what I use. It should be pretty easy to adjust it to other set-ups though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’ll be a few times where I’m going to say I &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; something to be the case. What this means, exactly, is that what I say is true to the best of my knowledge but I don’t know 100% for sure. Stuff where I’ve read something but not been able to test it, or made a reasonable assumption. Again, I welcome corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty involved. If you want a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; way to sandbox Steam and keep your /home free of its clutter then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;firejail&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--private=&lt;/code&gt; flag is a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier way of accomplishing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemd provides several mechanisms for interacting with containers. The simplest of these is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd-nspawn&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to run any valid container from anywhere. If you want the simplest possible solution you could ignore all the stuff where I mess with unit files and just use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd-nspawn&lt;/code&gt; to boot your container and then run things manually from that container’s command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted the most-automated approach so I’m using systemd to start the container as a service and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;machinectl&lt;/code&gt; to interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;machinectl&lt;/code&gt; to interact with a container by name I believe it must exist under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/lib/machines/&lt;/code&gt;. Symlinks &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work here but there’s currently a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2001&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; preventing this. Ideally I’d symlink into a directory in /home but since this doesn’t currently work I’m using actual directories in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/var/lib/machines/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nspawn supports various formats for containers, I’m using the simplest approach — actual directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When commands start with ‘#’ they should be run as root (or sudo for those who use it), when they begin with ‘$’ they can be run as a normal user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m calling my container ‘steamcontainer’, if you call yours something else, replace as necessary. My names is Drew and my username is drew. So replace all instances of drew with your username. Unless you are also Drew in which case hello namepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-creating-the-container&quot;&gt;1. Creating the container&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, with all that blabber out of the way, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn#Create_and_boot_a_minimal_Arch_Linux_distribution_in_a_container&quot;&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; describes this step well, as you’d expect, so I’m really just repeating what it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First make the directory where your container will live&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mkdir /var/lib/machines/steamcontainer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then install the base of Arch Linux into that container&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pacstrap -i -c -d /var/lib/machines/steamcontainer base --ignore linux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install other distros — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-nspawn#Create_a_Debian_or_Ubuntu_environment&quot;&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; explains how to install Debian and Ubuntu. However, I read in several places that for OpenGL (which, obviously, we need for games) to work, the graphics drivers must match exactly on host and container which I assume precludes running different distros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--ignore linux&lt;/code&gt; because the container doesn’t need a kernel, everything runs through the host’s kernel. So when the installer asks whether you want to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, say no. Defaults are fine for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that’s done, which should only take a few seconds, we can start the container and install all the other stuff we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-installing-all-the-other-stuff-we-need&quot;&gt;2. Installing all the other stuff we need&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boot the container with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemd-nspawn -b -D /var/lib/machines/steamcontainer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It boots like regular Linux! Pretty cool. When you get over the novelty, log in as root with no password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend changing root’s password now in case you fuck things up and need it at some point, so do that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# passwd root
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set whatever you like as root’s password then proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt; to enable multilib since we want the 32 bit stuff in the container. Nano will already be installed at this point, use that or install whichever text editor you like and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nano /etc/pacman.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And uncomment these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh the package stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pacman -Syu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let’s install all the stuff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pacman -S steam steam-native-runtime nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils alsa-utils sudo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose whatever fonts you like and select the libgl provider appropriate to your card (the default &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libglvnd&lt;/code&gt; is correct for recent Nvidia cards). Proceed with the installation, it should be a coupla hundred megs and shouldn’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; isn’t strictly necessary but it can make things easier later on. Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;visudo&lt;/code&gt; and set it up to your liking, of course. Also install your preferred tools like text editors and so on now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I use urxvt as my terminal and had to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rxvt-unicode-terminfo&lt;/code&gt; to get the shell to behave itself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also install a small graphical utility so you can test that X is working correctly. I use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nvidia-settings&lt;/code&gt; since that makes sense to me but you can use any graphical application you like (so long as it doesn’t need OpenGL, we’re not that far along yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-lets-see-if-x-works&quot;&gt;3. Let’s see if X works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok now we can test X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;strong&gt;WARNING&lt;/strong&gt; about security. To run graphical applications on the container you have to enable local connections to your X server. This allows anyone on your local network to connect to your X server and potentially do nefarious things. Rather than re-iterating at every point where this is relevant I’ll just say: Come up with a solution to this that you’re comfortable with. You could manually enable this each time you want to run a game and then disable it once the game is running, you could find a way to automate it or whatever else you like. I’m not going to tell you what to do, it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, so with that in mind, open a terminal &lt;strong&gt;on the host machine&lt;/strong&gt; and open up Xorg to local connections using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xhost&lt;/code&gt; (install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xorg-xhost&lt;/code&gt; if you don’t have it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ xhost +local:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re there, get the address of your current display&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ echo $DISPLAY
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll output something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;d@l ~ :) echo $DISPLAY                                      
:0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it outputs, use that when you set the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; environment variable on the container. I’ll be using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:0&lt;/code&gt;, replace as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then back to the &lt;strong&gt;container&lt;/strong&gt; shell and run your test application to see if X stuff is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$DISPLAY&lt;/code&gt; variable we talked about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# export $DISPLAY=:0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run your test application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nvidia-settings
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Obviously that can be run as a normal user but, if you’ve followed this to the letter, we don’t have one yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did it open? Good!|Oh no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume it did since if you’ve done everything correctly so far it really should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close your test app and get back to the container’s shell. There are a few more things to do before we move on to unit files and all that gubbins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam won’t run as root (nor do we want it to) so let’s create a normal user for Steam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash drew
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(replace ‘drew’ with the username you want. Mentioning it here because it’s the first time it’s come up and you may not have noticed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’ll add a user with the same primary group as their username and the additional group wheel, which is handy for things like sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[root@steamcontainer ~]# groups drew
wheel drew
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a password for that user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# passwd drew
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-sound-of-sound&quot;&gt;4. The Sound of Sound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games hook into ALSA rather than pulseuadio. We need to direct them to pulse so create &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/asound.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nano /etc/asound.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And put this in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Use PulseAudio by default
pcm.!default {
  type pulse
  fallback &quot;sysdefault&quot;
  hint {
    show on
    description &quot;Default ALSA Output (currently PulseAudio Sound Server)&quot;
  }
}

ctl.!default {
  type pulse
  fallback &quot;sysdefault&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what any of that means but it works. If you don’t use pulseaudio then you’re probably cleverer than me and know what to do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re here let’s do one last thing and set up the environment variables the container instance is going to need to talk to the things it needs to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/environment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# nano /etc/environment
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And add these two lines to the bottom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISPLAY=:0
PULSE_SERVER=unix:/run/user/host/pulse/native
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Adjusting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:0&lt;/code&gt; to the value you got, of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, we’re done in the container for now so close it down by holding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; and hitting &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; 3 times (the documentation says this only works on a US layout but it worked fine for me with my UK layout. If it doesn’t work try the key &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is on instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s hop to a shell on the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-units-and-that&quot;&gt;5. Units and that&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start the container with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt; but we need to override some defaults in order to get OpenGL and sound working. You can either create an override &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;steamcontainer&lt;/code&gt; container &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; one which applies to all containers started with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;. Since I’d like to have this ability available to all my (potential future) containers, I’m choosing the latter route. If you’d prefer to do the former then instead of the line below, you could do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;# systemctl edit systemd-nspawn@steamcontainer.service&lt;/code&gt;. It’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let’s create the override file (on the &lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mkdir /etc/systemd/system/systemd-nspawn@.service.d/
# nano /etc/systemd/system/systemd-nspawn@.service.d/override.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And put the following in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Service]
DeviceAllow=/dev/dri rw
DeviceAllow=/dev/shm rw
DeviceAllow=/dev/nvidia0 rw
DeviceAllow=/dev/nvidiactl rw
DeviceAllow=/dev/nvidia-modeset rw
DeviceAllow=char-usb_device rwm 
DeviceAllow=char-input rwm 
DeviceAllow=char-alsa rwm 
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemd-nspawn --quiet --keep-unit --boot --link-journal=try-guest --machine=%I
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first five lines after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Service]&lt;/code&gt; ensure that the container has read/write access to the stuff it needs for accelerated graphics. The next three lines pass input devices (so controllers work) and ALSA devices through (for sound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two lines override the default networking behaviour and just pass the host’s network through to the client. The reason I’ve done this is that when I was using the default configuration, Steam kept saying “There have been too many failed login attempts from this location” (when there had in fact been none). If you’d rather use the default networking behaviour and see if the same happens to you (or fix it!), go for it — omit those last two lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.nspawn&lt;/code&gt; file which contains specific runtime settings for particular containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that some of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bind&lt;/code&gt; directives mirror what’s in the other file and some don’t. This is because normal filesystem binds are, by default, read/write whereas binds to kernel subsystems are, by default, read-only and need to be set to read/write above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot of that is that you can add as many additional filesystem binds here as you like. I’ve added my Downloads directory, for example, so that I can access any games downloaded outside of Steam in the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s make that file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mkdir /etc/systemd/nspawn/
# nano /etc/systemd/nspawn/steamcontainer.nspawn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And put the following in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Exec]
Boot=1

[Files]
# nvidia-opengl
Bind=/tmp/.X11-unix
Bind=/dev/dri
Bind=/dev/shm
Bind=/dev/nvidia0
Bind=/dev/nvidiactl
Bind=/dev/nvidia-modeset

# input
Bind=/dev/input

# pulseaudio
Bind=/run/user/1000/pulse:/run/user/host/pulse

# alsa
Bind=/dev/snd

# downloads
Bind=/home/drew/Downloads

# Pacman cache
Bind=/var/cache/pacman/pkg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should all be pretty self-explanatory with the comments. It’s not necessary to bind Pacman’s cache, I’ve just done that since the host and container may as well share the same cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my container I’ve got an extra bind which links an external Steam library into the home folder of my user on the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-testing-it-all-out&quot;&gt;6. Testing it all out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now start the container as a service using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;. Once it’s running we can interact with it using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;machinectl&lt;/code&gt; to do things like open a shell or run a command as a particular user. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;systemd-run&lt;/code&gt; can also be used to run commands but can’t run commands on remote machines (containers count as remote) as normal users, which is why I’m using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;machinectl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start the container as a service (on the &lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemctl start systemd-nspawn@steamcontainer.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can obviously put that command in a file that’s run at startup to have the container run automatically. I’ve put it in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; file. Normally you’d just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/code&gt; the service but for me it always fails because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/dev/nvidia-modeset&lt;/code&gt; seems to be created after any target I’ve tried, causing the service to fail. Feel free to mess with that and let me know if you find a way to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemctl status systemd-nspawn@steamcontainer.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check everything’s ok if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so our container is up and running, let’s connect to it and see if stuff works. Remember you’ll need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;host +local:&lt;/code&gt; set on the host machine if you want to run graphical things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# machinectl shell drew@steamcontainer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace ‘drew’ with the username of the user you created on the container. You should see a shell for your normal user. Let’s run steam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ steam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steam runs! Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install some games (or bind an external Steam library in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/systemd/nspawn/steamcontainer.nspawn&lt;/code&gt; and then add it in Steam) and try them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to restart the service between config changes by doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# systemctl restart systemd-nspawn@steamcontainer.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;restart&lt;/code&gt; if you prefer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got everything to your liking, rather than opening a shell and typing the name of the command you want to run you can use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# machinectl shell drew@steamcontainer /usr/bin/steam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start any executable. You can obviously put that command somewhere where it autostarts or add it into a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.desktop&lt;/code&gt; file or a shell script, key combo — whatever method you prefer. You can edit the last bit to run anything you like on the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve moved my Wine prefixes into my container user’s home directory (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;man machinectl&lt;/code&gt; and see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;copy-to&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;copy-from&lt;/code&gt;) and installed Wine on the container so I can completely rid my host machine of 32 bit libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it is all working. It looks… like Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/nspawn_steam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/nspawn_steam.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I’ve noticed that doesn’t work is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;steam://&lt;/code&gt; protocol links from web browsers etc.. Presumably because Steam is running on a different ‘machine’ to the web browser. I’ve never had any use for those links though so that doesn’t bother me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Night in the Woods</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/night-in-the-woods/"/>
   <updated>2017-02-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/night-in-the-woods</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Night in the Woods is a (largely-)linear-narrative explorationy adventure game — very much not the sort of thing I usually enjoy — but the preview material for this game intrigued me enough to try it and I’m &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upfront &lt;strong&gt;reverse-quasi-spoiler-warning&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ll try my very hardest to avoid spoiling anything about this game since much of the enjoyment will come from discovering things for yourself. That’s going to make this a bit difficult since I’ll be unable to describe the things that affected me the most in anything but the vaguest terms. If you’re &lt;em&gt;reallllly&lt;/em&gt; spoiler-sensitive you might want to stop reading…. &lt;strong&gt;NOW&lt;/strong&gt;(ish).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night in the Woods tells the story of Mae Borowski, an anthropomorphic cat who has just dropped out of college and returned to her small-town home of Possum Springs hoping to pick up her life where she left off. While things are superficially familiar, she finds that the town is changed and her friends have grown up, got jobs and moved on with their lives. The past she wishes to recapture no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possum Springs will be familiar to any of us who’ve lived in a small provincial town, especially one with an industrial past. The town is decaying, possibly dying, as postmodernity and late capitalism collide, disconnecting the people and place from its history and leaving many of its inhabitants lost — proud of their heritage and community while alienated from its present and unsure of its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town and its surroundings are beautifully rendered both in terms of the gorgeous artwork and through the dialogue of its inhabitants. There’s an aching feeling when talking to the townspeople of a place that is still home to many real people with real lives but which has simply outlived its usefulness to a world that’s moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_statue.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_statue.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mae is similarly full of character, I’ve grown rather attached to her during the couple of days we spent together. She’s tactless, impulsive, irrepressibly childish and naive. She’s also loving, imaginative, fiercely loyal and brave to a fault. She’s flawed and all the more loveable for it. She’s deeply &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; (I hope that’s not offensive to anthropomorphic cat-people) and one of the most complex and interesting characters I’ve ever encountered in a game. Mae’s no longer a child but hasn’t yet embraced adulthood — she’s struggling to find herself a place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is spent exploring Possum Springs and its surroundings and interacting with its inhabitants including Mae’s closest friends. Each day you get to decide which of Mae’s friends to hang out with that evening. I won’t describe them all, I’ll let you get to know them for yourself, but I was particularly drawn to Mae’s friend Bea — a chain-smoking, incisively intelligent, overworked alligator. The more time you spend with a particular friend, the more you get to see of their lives and personalities, creating resonances with and adding meaning to later events within the story. Mae and Bea had their ups and downs — I felt quite genuine joy, sadness and guilt during my time with her as each got to know the person the other had become. Every evening spent with Bea felt like a special memory, each in a uniquely distinct way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_portrait.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_portrait.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early game is about getting to know the town and its inhabitants through your relationships with them and the activities you share. Mae’s family, the man down the street who told me about the stars, the neighbourhood poet, the weird teens, the normal teens, the creepy kid who likes horror films, the rats, the possum and all the rest. They all feel profoundly alive, vibrant and are deeply affecting. The characterisations are flawless with everyone feeling like a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; rather than a cliché — adults talk and seem to think like adults and kids are like kids, characters have worries, problems and complexities, and faults and contradictions aren’t shied away from or glossed over, they’re embraced as what makes us human (or cat, bear, alligator, bird …).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much I can’t say, so many little encounters and events or time spent with characters that meant so much to me and added more meaning to the rest of the game. The writing, art and music are all beautiful and work perfectly together to create a real place where real people live and work, a &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt; with a proud history and uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part-way through the game a mystery is uncovered which Mae takes it upon herself to solve. Through doing so she learns even more about the town and gets to know its people even better. That’s all I’m saying about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_garbage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/night_in_the_woods_garbage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night in the woods is a beautiful and moving game. It’s about getting to know Mae, her friends and the town she calls her home. It’s about relationships — Mae’s with her family, friends and neighbours, of course, but also the peoples’ with their town and the town’s with a changing world. The game doesn’t shy away from complexity, embraces ambiguity and, while feeling fully satisfying as a complete narrative, leaves some aspects of its world pleasingly unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also there’s a mystery &lt;sup&gt;&lt;del&gt;about which I will say nothing&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this game and Mae is my new favourite computer game character. Bea is my new &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;-favourite computer game character. Unless you’re made of stone I think you’ll love it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get Night in the Woods from &lt;a href=&quot;https://finji.itch.io/night-in-the-woods&quot;&gt;Itch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/481510/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/night_in_the_woods&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Shadow-Tactics/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Shadow-Tactics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a real-time tactics game in the vein of Commandos and Desperados, a genre that’s really gone neglected since the early 00s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with those games, the gist is that you infiltrate enemy territory with a handful of characters, making use of their special abilities to progress through expansive levels which are presented in a three-quarters top-down view. Success is about using these characters together in real-time to overcome or bypass obstacles in order to reach objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing shadow Tactics feels like a happy mélange of puzzle game, tactical RPG and action game. Most of your time will be spent carefully considering how best to position your characters and use their skills — looking at the level and the tools you have, going “Hmmm” a lot and coming up with a solution that you like. Sometimes you’ll be reacting to something unexpected — an overlooked guard spotting you, a patrol noticing your footprints in the snow or an enemy hearing something you thought they wouldn’t — the instances when you manage to turn a surprise to your advantage are hugely satisfying. For the most part, though, the game rewards cautious, thoughtful creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_woods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_woods.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player characters — Hayato, a mercenary ninja; jolly samurai Mugen; cackling old sniper Takuma; excitable urchin Yuki and Aiko, savvy courtier and spy — are, unlike those in Commandos and Desperados, well characterised and likeable. Their interplay during missions and cutscenes is &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt;, deepening my affection for them, never becoming tired or grating. Yuki’s humming to herself when she sets her spring trap is utterly adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ytvid&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z-tu2G3qQqQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Tactics is nicely grounded in its historical Japanese setting. I’m certainly no expert on Japan’s feudal period but it feels like the developers approached the setting with respect without letting it dominate. The option to have dialogue be in Japanese (with, in my case, English subtitles) is welcome — if these characters are Japanese then I want them speaking Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels are sprawling, &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt; crafted and truly open-ended — there’s a goal or series of goals to accomplish, but how you go about that is entirely up to you and there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways to proceed. I’ve been playing a lot of roguelikes and it’s nice to return to something with hand-crafted levels, particularly of this quality. They feel like a return to a time when players were given many options, lots of tools and a huge space to play in and trusted to decide what to do themselves — given the freedom to get stuck or confused and to think their way out of it, enjoying the satisfaction of having done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_snow.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_snow.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another welcome anachronism is the quicksave. Flying contrary to recent game design trends, Shadow Tactics is &lt;em&gt;brazen&lt;/em&gt; about its reliance on quicksaves. There’s even a little timer up at the top which pops up when it’s been a minute since your last save and becomes increasingly alarming in shade the longer it’s been (easily disabled in the options if you don’t like that sort of thing). The game is saying: Play around! Try things out! Experiment! Learn this game at your own pace and don’t be afraid to innovate! Have &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;! Quicksaves are a mechanic like any other. Sometimes abused, sure, but not inherently bad. This game is not ashamed of its quicksaving and I love it for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully navigating missions hinges on using your characters together — using Aiko to distract a guard while Yuki lures another into her trap just as Hayato distracts a fourth and kills the one Aiko distracted in the first place. Observing guards’ patrol routes and checking their view cones, looking for blind-spots and openings, is essential. Each character has a distraction skill, the ability to kill up-close and a third skill such as Yuki’s trap and Hayato’s shuriken. The distraction skills all do the same &lt;em&gt;sort&lt;/em&gt; of thing, but they work differently enough that they offer real choices when approaching a situation — Yuki’s flute lures a guard over to investigate whereas Hayato’s thrown stone just causes guards to look in a particular direction and Aiko can pin guards in position, looking in a particular direction, if she converses with them while disguised. There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways to deal with a particular network of guards with their overlapping vision cones and choosing amongst potential solutions is often about style — not just solving the puzzle but doing so in an aesthetically and ludicly satisfying way — not just winning, but winning with &lt;em&gt;panache&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To aid you in finessing things up, &lt;em&gt;shadow mode&lt;/em&gt; is a tool which allows you to give each character one action to perform and then, when you press enter, have them perform those actions simultaneously. Executing a complex plan in this fashion and watching your little people carry it out successfully is &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_cone.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_cone.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels are huge and varied; from highland passes to castles to mountaintop temples. Some have mechanical twists, like a snowy town where player characters will leave dissipating footprints which guards will follow when spotted. Or a village at night-time with reduced vision cones and light sources which can be extinguished to allow a character to sneak past or to act as a distraction or lure — guards will attempt to re-light extinguished torches if they notice they’ve gone out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is refreshingly sensible. Not smart, as such — AI can’t be too smart in a stealth game without ruining things — but sensible enough for their behaviour to make sense and be predictable. Guards’ view cones have a solid area and a hatched area, they will see you in the solid area whether standing or crouching but they will only see you in the hatched area when standing. Areas which are, from a guard’s perspective, behind waist-high cover will always be hatched which makes low cover &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; useful for sneaking around. Being spotted is not instantaneous, when you enter a view cone the guard will become alert and the cone will gradually change colour in your direction — if you get out of the view cone before the second colour reaches you, you remain unseen. When guards think they’ve seen or heard something they will search around the suspicious area, checking bushes and other likely hiding spots before returning to their regular position. If you are fully detected then an alarm is raised and additional guards will emerge from buildings, making the entire level tougher. A nice approach that bypasses the “I guess it was nothing after all” problem that some stealth games suffer from. A non-lethal approach is possible but knocked-out guards will only stay that way for a very short time, so it’s &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; harder, as it really should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_tree.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_tree.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the different challenges of static and patrolling guards, there are guards with straw hats who are harder to distract and also samurai which only Mugen can take down alone — other characters have to work in concert to overcome them. The quite significant verticality of the levels adds further challenge to stealthing your way around — you have to be very careful about being seen from above. The nimbler player characters can, of course, use this verticality to their advantage — scampering across rooftops, leaping between buildings and drop-killing unsuspecting guards from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each level has a series of &lt;em&gt;badges&lt;/em&gt; which are revealed to you when you complete them or at the end of your first play-through of a given level. Things like complete the level without touching a bush, without killing anyone or within a certain time limit. I &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much like that they are only revealed &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; your first play-through since this allows you to play &lt;em&gt;how you want to play&lt;/em&gt; the first time through, rather than feeling obliged, as we often are despite ourselves, to collect as many badges as we can. First time through you get to just &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; the level as the wonderful playground it is, playing it in your own way. Then, after completing it once, you can return for extra challenges — and they’re a lot of fun. This is smart design by developers who care about their game. There’s immense replayability here. Not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; in collecting all the badges but also just trying other approaches, different solutions or using one character more, rather than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_roof.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_tactics_roof.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artistic direction and design is exquisite throughout. The UI is concise, clear and beautiful, with plentiful tooltips which make learning the controls a breeze. Levels are rendered with a sumptuous naturalism and it’s a joy to be able to pan and rotate freely around them. Writing and acting are excellent and cutscenes are stunning, the excellent story is delivered deftly without ever feeling intrusive. Menus are sensible and the main screen, the screen you get when you start the game (from which I took the header image for this post) is &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. Little affordances like the quicksave timer, being able to review conversations, the fluency of the controls and the easy access to multiple saves make it plain that someone really &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; about this game, it feels utterly refined. It’s &lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt; that a small team (that I’d never heard of) made this game, it exudes quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Tactics is a game to &lt;em&gt;savour&lt;/em&gt;. To take your time with and experiment, find better or cooler solutions, different approaches. To &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with and fully explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a bad word to say about it. And the Linux version is, in my experience, flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/418240/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun&quot;&gt;Humble Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/shadow_tactics_blades_of_the_shogun&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s even a demo which the Shogun &lt;em&gt;commands&lt;/em&gt; you to try.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Dwarves</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/The-Dwarves/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/The-Dwarves</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Dwarves is a narrative RPG with interesting real-time pauseable combat mechanics. The game’s marketing has tried really hard to sell this as an all-out action RPG and I think that’s a shame since it’s really not. And what it actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; is far more interesting than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve not read the novel this game is based on&lt;/strong&gt; and have no particular interest in doing so. I’m not going to be talking about how the game relates to the book since I neither know nor care. I’m judging it as a game in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dwarves has three distinct modes of play — the overworld map, which plays like a choose-your-own-adventure as you move from location to location and are presented with textual vignettes as you meet people and encounter settlements; combat levels when you meet enemies or decide to attack someone as a result of your choices and exploration sections, presented in the same way as the combat levels, but most resembling a point and click adventure game where you must look for clues to solve a puzzle to open a secret door or reveal a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/dwarves_map.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dwarves_map.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blending of these three modes really successfully evokes the feeling of playing through a storybook — not &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; a story, it’s distinctly active, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the protagonist and your agency is profound — the different paces suggest the cadence and rhythm of a written story, with the travel sections being more suggestive than explicit, the exploration and adventure passages being more detailed, personal and affective and combat being hectic and precarious while still having a strategic feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles tend to be set-pieces — a single map where you have a specific objective like protect so many villagers, kill all the enemies or get to the exit without dying. Combat is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; physicsy with many skills involving throwing or pushing enemies around to manage them. When combat starts you can take any four of your party members into the battle and they can each have any four of their unlocked skills active. The key to combat is to choose the right party members and skills for the particular battle and to use them together effectively — lots of pausing, issuing orders to multiple characters and then unpausing to see how your plan plays out. It’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; satisfying — there have been several occasions where my plan just clearly was not good and I had to stop and have a re-think about my approach, opening up character sheets and looking at skills, trying to spot synergies I’d overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/dwarves_fight.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dwarves_fight.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the combat levels have obstacles like pits or fires that enemies can be pushed into for an instant kill and using your team’s skills to push enemies around into just the perfect position so that one of your characters can just sweep them into a chasm is &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; satisfying. Fights have a lovely immediacy to them, they’re violent and brutal in a satisfyingly chunky way — very dwarfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When not told to use a specific skill your party members won’t just stand there like fucking idiots, oblivious to the turmoil around them, they’ll stay roughly in position but will use their basic attack on nearby enemies. You don’t have to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; them to not just stand there while getting whaled on by orcs, which is a real blessing. Affordances and simplifications like this (you can’t, as far as I’ve found, queue up orders, for example) prevent combat from feeling like micro-management; this isn’t about giving a load of orders from an aloof position, you feel like you’re &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the battle, shouting orders to your friends, trying things out and seeing the enemy react, and then reacting to their reaction. Battles are immediate and intense while also feeling strategically satisfying — a combination I can’t recall experiencing in another game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanical character development is pretty shallow. There are no weapons or armour to equip and the skill trees are basically linear, with characters just getting the next skill when they level up, with the occasional choice between two. I don’t actually mind this and it’s certainly better than having lots of almost-the-same skills to chose from and that feeling of grinding XP to get to the skill you really want. The characters each have specific personalities and their skills are specific to that role. This isn’t a game about having a vast number of tools, it’s about having a decent number of well-differentiated tools and using them well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is lovely, that sounds lazy but it’s the right word. The main character, Tungdil, is an earnest, sweet young dwarf who was raised by humans and dreams of seeing the world. Guess whether he gets to? This is proper high fantasy at its uncomplicated, heroic best. Which for me makes a refreshing change from all the &lt;em&gt;oh so dark and broody&lt;/em&gt; troubled anti-heroes that plague everything. Uncomplicated is not to say unsophisticated, the moral ambiguity, tough choices and darkness are all in there, it’s just not thrust in your face every five seconds in a desperate clamouring to prove how edgy it is. It’s proudly high fantasy with noble, virtuous characters to &lt;em&gt;balance&lt;/em&gt; the troubled brooders, and I very much like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/dwarves_home.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dwarves_home.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is beautiful and its literary heritage is plain, I was hooked within the first few minutes as Tungdil’s home and its inhabitants were described to me, as I explored, with artful efficiency — short, evocative passages that made me feel like I knew this person and his home in no time at all. The voice acting is generally good — some great, some merely ok — but the narrator is &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;; warmly lulling you into becoming a part of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quality continues through to the choose-your-own adventure style events and places in the overworld map. It’s all beautifully described and encounters are engaging and seemingly quite open-ended. This is a very focussed narrative game which has a good story to tell and it does so beautifully, but without robbing the player of agency, choice and freedom. While largely linear, it very much feels like &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest part of the game is the party management. As you adventure, you will find or buy various artefacts and objects that, when equipped, give buffs. The interface for assigning these to particular characters is vague at best — I actually have no idea who’s got what and, since characters don’t have an individual inventory distinct from the party’s inventory, I have no way to check. Not far into the game I just gave up trying to give particular people particular things. It’s not a huge deal as I’ve only encountered a few of these objects but it’s a shame to lose this avenue of further specialising your characters. It’s also impossible to easily compare two characters when considering them for the upcoming battle — there’s no way to see two side-by-side — to assign them to the current battle you tick little boxes on their faces which is, again, vague. The whole party management UI is atrocious and I dearly hope it sees a complete re-design in a patch, I want to see, at a glance, who’s assigned to the battle-party and be able to drop people in and out of that, compare them, give them stuff and so on. It’s not the end of the world since you don’t interact with this interface a huge amount, but it’s a significant kink in an otherwise well designed game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/dwarves_ui.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dwarves_ui.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the combat UI, with which you’ll interact far more frequently, has no such shortcomings and is perfectly efficient. The camera can act a bit stupid when it gets close to things like walls but that’s an annoyance rather than a real hindrance and should be easy to fix in a patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game currently has no vsync option but the devs say they’re working on that. If that’s a deal-breaker for you then wait for a patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dwarves is equal parts choose-your-own-adventure and quite innovative strategic action-combat with a bit of point-and-click adventure thrown in. Amazingly, these three parts sit well together and feel like a cohesive whole whose purpose is to bring a wonderfully engaging epic fantasy story to life. It feels like a seamless experience with a varied tempo and tone rather than a collection of disparate parts. It’s an unusual structure but it works perfectly and I’d love to see the developers refine and expand it further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combat in particular shines — not because it’s better than the others parts, they’re all good, but because it manages to feel both actiony &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; strategic. It’s exciting and intense but will also have you pausing and thinking hard. It’s simple in all the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; places — there’s no fiddly movement, micro-managing actions or choosing from a hundred basically identical skills — to free the player up so that they can really think about how to use their party members, with their distinct skills and personalities, to best effect. It’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/dwarves_adventure.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dwarves_adventure.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only reservation in terms of recommending this game is its price. &lt;em&gt;I’ve&lt;/em&gt; thoroughly enjoyed every minute with it and I feel like it’s &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; worth the cost. But £30ish is a lot of money for a game. If you like the sound of it and the price seems fair to you then I’d say go for it — it’s an excellent, interesting realisation of what a narrative action RPG can be. If you’re unsure, then perhaps hold off for a sale.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-10-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Meadow</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meadow is a sedate game about exploration, co-operation and non-verbal communication. It’s a multi-user wilderness in which you take on the role of an animal cub and, along with others, work out what the world is about. Here’s the story of my first couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself, a badger cub, in a meadow filled with white flowers. There was a huge tree in the distance and woodland on other sides. I walked around a bit, getting accustomed to movement, and spotted another badger cub a short distance away, I waddled over and called to it. The other badger called back and walked towards me. We eyed and circled each other curiously. The other badger jumped! I didn’t know I could jump — I hit spacebar and I jumped too. We ran around each other jumping and calling for a while, then settled down and both emoted ‘happy’. I laughed out loud and felt a small joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After frolicking a for a while longer in delight at finding another like us we silently decided to start exploring together. We set off into the woods, sometimes sprinting, sometimes just strolling idly, sometimes leaping on rocks and logs and running through grass. Every now and then we would call to each other or emote ‘happy’ or what I took to mean ‘pack’ or ‘friends’ and another emote which I took to mean ‘journey’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we encountered a pack of about seven other animals — lynxes, rabbits, other badgers and tiny frogs — all cubs. We called out continuously while sprinting towards them and, when they saw/heard us they started calling out too and ran to meet us. We jumped, frolicked and emoted for a while and then a small fire appeared so we all decided to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short nap the pack continued its journey. I made friends with a lynx cub — we would range out slightly from the rest of the pack, jumping, calling and emoting ‘happy’— playing together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_lynx.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_lynx.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed several rivers (when doing so most animals would continuously emote ‘sad’ since swimming is very slow. But the frogs swam very very quickly and would emote ‘happy’ while racing past us) and entered a snowy area, eventually coming to a huge icy lake. We’d been joined by several other creatures by this point including a couple of adult lynxes. The lynxes became the leaders — I think we all assumed they must know what they’re doing, being adults — and we followed them across the lake to an area with beautiful waterfalls and a cave entrance. The lynxes entered the cave and emoted ‘pack’, ‘cave’ and ‘journey’. We cubs edged towards the cave entrance cautiously looking in and eventually following. I don’t know who started moving first or even whether any one creature did, the pack mind just made a decision and we all went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_caves.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_caves.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caves were very pretty, we ran through them jumping in delight and emoting ‘happy’. A few occasionally emoted ‘sad’, which we took in context to mean ‘scared’ — we’d huddle around those who were scared and call to them reassuringly. There were many paths inside the caves and the pack would sometimes split at a fork, joining back together at a later junction (or perhaps it was just a different pack joining us, it’s sometimes hard to tell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lynx cub friend and I had stuck together, making sure to choose the same paths when the cave forked, but eventually, when we came to a huge cavern with waterfalls and trees inside, we chose different paths. There was a spiralling walkway around the outside of the cavern and a choice of two directions — up or down. I wanted to go up and my lynx friend wanted to follow the majority of the pack downwards. We faced each other and called, emoting sad a few times, then reluctantly parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_cave.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_cave.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was with a smaller group now, a few rabbits, frogs, badgers, a lynx or two and an adult deer. We exited the cave system and explored the surrounding woodlands, eventually coming to some sort of rune stone. We didn’t know what to do with the rune stone — some of us tried climbing it, emoting various things at it, calling to it and so on but nothing seemed to have any effect. We all agreed ‘rune stone’, ‘question’ and ‘sad’. Very ‘sad’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_rune.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_rune.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while later I split off from the group and explored on my own for a bit. I climbed a mountain and found a crystal and many flower-sparkles. I came to the edge of the world and looked off — I saw what I think was the sun (it’d been a continuous night time for me so far). For a long time I saw no other creatures — I explored the mountains, found another cave with some beautiful, crystalline chambers and others of shimmery ice. I wandered through forests, plains and meadows enjoying it all but feeling increasingly lonely. It wasn’t the same without someone to say ‘happy’ to. I missed my lynx friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_edge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_edge.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time later I encountered another pack, different from my last. My previous pack had been raucous — a swirling, chaotic mass of animals herding together, jumping and calling and emoting incessantly. This new pack was far more orderly — a dozen or so cubs following a fully grown deer called Sarah (I’d found the button to show names) who had a beautifully patterned coat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah was methodically leading her pack around to the runes, most of which unlocked when we arrived — I don’t know how. We had a more organised language now — we used specific emotes for ‘rune stone’ and ‘crystal’ and ‘flower sparkles’ so that if any of us spotted those things we could communicate it to the rest of the pack who would then follow us. We could also communicate ‘climb ahead’ and ‘this way’. We collected a lot of crystals and sparkles, we were very organised and methodical, but I missed the raw exuberance, playfulness and &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; that characterised my previous pack. After a while, when Sarah’s pack was at a standstill, having a rest, I emoted ‘sad’ and ‘journey’ a couple of times and moved away, turning back to see if I was understood. A few replied ‘sad’ and ‘pack’ and we parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/meadow_sarah.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meadow_sarah.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On exiting the game I discovered that I’ll be able to be a frog next time I play, I’m looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meadow is £1.99 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/486310/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>GoNNER</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/GoNNER/"/>
   <updated>2016-10-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/GoNNER</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;GoNNER is a somewhat-roguelike action platformer with a &lt;em&gt;sumptuously gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic. It’s also pretty hard — I’m not really very good at platformers or side-scrolling games in general — so I’ve not yet got beyond world two. I believe it’s a fairly short game but I wouldn’t know for sure because &lt;em&gt;I keep dying&lt;/em&gt;. But having a lot of &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt; doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it when games don’t explain too much — when they leave things mysterious and provide you with the means to figure stuff out yourself. GoNNER doesn’t tell you what &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; in it is, but does an excellent job through its visual and kinetic language of allowing you to work out what things are and what they do. You start the game without a head and your first job is to find one — I’m still not entirely clear on what the effects of the different heads are but I’ve noticed that they &lt;em&gt;change things&lt;/em&gt;, I’m keeping it intentionally vague; I don’t want to spoil your joy of discovery should you decide to play this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/gonner_level.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gonner_level.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a beautiful game — the levels and characters look stunning, the animations are fluid and communicative and the music augments the rest perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each world has its own style of level — those in world one are enclosed, with lots of walls to jump around on, while world two’s levels are all open skies and perilous drops. The level draws around you pleasingly as you move, representing your field of view, in one of this game’s nods to the roguelike form. Other nods include somewhat procedural levels — each world will always have the same levels in the same order but they look different each time, things are moved around and re-jigged for each run; there’s no saving — dying means starting over from the beinning and there are various weapons, heads and accessories (each of which enables a different special move) to find. These pickups are saved between runs — at the start of each game you can choose to visit death where you can select from the heads, weapons and accessories you’ve discovered so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, yet, why I can change my heads. I don’t know why I seem to be quite pally with death and my best friend seems to be a whale. Nor do I know why I start each level being shat out by a giant worm and end each level by jumping into the worm’s mouth. The symbolism is lovely and esoteric, I’m enjoying soaking it up and coming up with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/gonner_shoot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gonner_shoot.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The levels are like little playgorunds and, with a little practise, you’re bounding around, stringing together jumps, wall-jumps and double jumps to pull off improbable acrobatic feats of violence as you kill enemies with gunshots and head-jumps. The controls are pleasantly responsive and everything has a nice physical feel to it — the shotgun, my preferred weapon so far, flings you backwards a little when used, for example, which can be deadly or useful, depending on your skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoNNER’s design is elegant in its simplicity — there’s no waste, nothing extraneous, no distraction — everything on-screen communicates something. Enemies and environments are varied but readable and motion and actions are explicit such that, when you die (and you will, a lot), it’s always &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fault. It’s deliciously frustratingly fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/gonner_face.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gonner_face.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t but recommend GoNNER, £6.99 is a steal for such a beautiful, smart, satisfying little game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only caveat is that there’s currently no v-sync option. It doesn’t tear, for me at least, I just get more frames than I need. I’m sure this will be fixed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoNNER is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/437570&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/gonner&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/gonner&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the launch trailer because you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have to see it &lt;em&gt;moving&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rocket League</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/rocket-league-not-dick/"/>
   <updated>2016-10-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/rocket-league-not-dick</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a lot of hours in Rocket League and, while I’m not actually very &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; very &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt;. So I thought I’d share what I’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be about how to improve your technical skill — the way to do that is to &lt;em&gt;practise&lt;/em&gt; lots by playing games and doing training. This is going to be about how to play well as a member of a team and will pertain mainly to 3 vs. 3, since that’s what I play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical skill is important, of course, but I think teamwork is perhaps more important. I’ve been in countless games where a team with far more skill has lost to technically inferior players because the inferior players &lt;em&gt;worked together&lt;/em&gt;. So here’s what I’ve learned in my 17.5 million hours of Rocket League about being a &lt;em&gt;team player&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-ignore-the-scoreboard&quot;&gt;1. Ignore the scoreboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to a point, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scoring in Rocket League rewards ball-chasing and ball-chasing makes you a &lt;em&gt;bad team member&lt;/em&gt;. It also gives a lot of points for &lt;em&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt; (shots on goal) and for scoring goals, which may seem fair enough but I’ll get to that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scoring system &lt;em&gt;does not reward&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in position to intercept a counter-attack while your team-mates attack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bumping an enemy (and they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the enemy) player off the ball or out of position (or demoing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staying on the ground while your team-mate attempts to aerial a threatening high ball away, in case they miss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passing the ball (unless it’s an assist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; basic plays the game does reward with points (that is ignoring stuff like aerial touches and juggles) are: Goals, shots, assists and clears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say I’m in an offensive position with the ball but the defence is in place and prepared. I could take a shot but it’s very likely to be saved and that’s very likely to result in a counter-attack. The game would &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; me for doing something &lt;em&gt;very stupid&lt;/em&gt;, harming my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, I could lay the ball off or hit it off the back wall to draw the defence out — this may not end up as an assist, there are likely to be more touches before any goal is scored — either way, I either get fewer points or none at all for doing something &lt;em&gt;very smart&lt;/em&gt; which helps my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, don’t pay too much attention to the scoreboard. I’m not saying it doesn’t matter at all, nor am I really criticising how it works — they &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; make it perfect. But if you pay too much attention to your score it will make you play badly. You &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; whether you’re playing well or not and that matters more than your score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-dont-chase-the-ball&quot;&gt;2. Don’t chase the ball&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, &lt;em&gt;don’t chase the fucking ball&lt;/em&gt;. I’d rather play with someone who’s playing for the very first time and has literally zero experience than someone with lots of skill who chases the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said, the scoreboard rewards ball-chasing so lots of people seem to think they’re playing well just because they’re racking up points every time they hit the ball. They seem to have no sense that they’re not hitting the ball &lt;em&gt;usefully&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t be that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time you are not going to be the best person to hit a particular ball. There are three of you so, as a rule of thumb, you’re probably going to be the best person to deal with roughly 1/3 of balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you chase the ball around you are doing two really bad things for your team:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hitting the ball poorly when someone else could have hit it well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing your team-mates to play out of position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, the ball chaser, may even score lots of goals. You see the scoreboard at the end of the game, you scored 3 goals and have the top score on your team, the rest of your team scored no goals. You lost 4 - 3. Because of your ball chaser mentality, you think you played well and were let down by your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can’t be shown is that, if you had played less selfishly, taking less stupid shots, doing fewer shitty clears, not hitting the ball sideways in midfield for no reason at all, then perhaps your team would’ve scored 5 goals or conceded only 2 and you would have won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-rotations-and-positioning&quot;&gt;3. Rotations and positioning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioning rules in Rocket League are all situational. They are &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; true but there are times when you should break them. It’s hard to un-learn bad habits though so learn to play positionally &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;, then you’ll learn how and when you can improvise naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever position you are in if you are not doing one of these two things then you are not helping your team and are probably harming them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usefully&lt;/em&gt; hitting the ball&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting/staying in position to deal with a usefully hit ball (whether offensively or defensively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re trying to centre the ball for your team around the side wall in the corner. The ball gets intercepted weakly and becomes a dead ball. &lt;strong&gt;Do not hang around near that ball&lt;/strong&gt; because you are neither hitting the ball nor getting into a position to receive a usefully hit ball. The &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; that can happen in this situation is that you hit the ball weakly and nothing at all is gained. Meanwhile, you are, because of your shitty positioning, preventing your team-mate from rotating in and hitting the ball with force — if they do so, there’ll be no one to accept the centre and score because &lt;strong&gt;you are sitting uselessly under the ball&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies equally to clearing the ball in a defensive position. If you go to clear the ball and it’s blocked, becoming dead, you &lt;em&gt;are no use there any more&lt;/em&gt; — get out of there and let someone else hit it. There’s nothing more frustrating when in goal than to see someone sitting in the corner repeatedly hitting the ball weakly when you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you could clear it solidly if they would only rotate with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, if you are not either &lt;em&gt;playing the ball usefully&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;getting into a position to deal with a played ball&lt;/em&gt; then you are &lt;strong&gt;playing badly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking you should hit the ball once and then let a team-mate take over as, if they’re playing well, they will have been getting into a position to do exactly that. This is not always true — sometimes you will be best placed to continue hitting the ball — but broadly speaking, aim for a passing style, it’s much harder to defend against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-attack&quot;&gt;On the attack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three positions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The furthest player forwards, we’ll call this “1”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player furthest back, we’ll call this “3”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The one in the middle, we’ll call this “2”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your position on the pitch dictates your role. If you are closest to goal during the kickoff then you are in position 3 and if you go for either boost or the ball at kickoff then you are an arsehole. Don’t. Let the kickoff play out before going anywhere – you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; boost at this point, you have 34 which is enough to get to any ball. Stay in goal and be ready for a surprise shot. When it’s clear where the ball is going &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you can move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic roles of those three positions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drive the ball forwards and try to get your team into a scoring position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in position to receive a pass or intercept a rebound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defending against counter-attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once 1 has hit the ball, unless they’re best placed to hit it again, they should rotate with whoever is. In an attacking play, 1 should rotate with 2 and they should swap roles. If things go wrong and a counter-attack ensues then 2 should attempt to intercept the ball, 3 should rotate forward to take 2’s place and 1 should rotate back to 3. This won’t always be exactly right — it depends where the ball goes. The point, though, is that all three players should be constantly rotating to maintain those three roles in such a way that the person in the best position to hit any particular ball can do so in the knowledge that their team-mates will plug the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3’s job during all this is to watch the play &lt;em&gt;very carefully&lt;/em&gt; and push up the field as much as they safely can. Watch the enemy cars; be careful to look at their positions in relation to the ball so you can gauge how far they can hit it — don’t go any further forward than that. Your job is to get back to goal if a counter attack happens but also to push forwards if neither 1 nor 2 can go for a shot, in which case 1 or 2 will rotate back to take your place if they’re any good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-defence&quot;&gt;In defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can get messy, when you’re under attack rotations are likely to fall apart as your position will be less clearly defined. What you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to avoid in a defensive position is two or more people going to clear the same ball as this will leave a hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always want someone in goal, on the ground, as a last resort against a shot. Which player this is will change. The other two players should be attempting to clear the ball, ideally &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it becomes a shot. When a ball goes up high near your goal, player 1 should be going up for that to get rid of it before it becomes a shot. Same for balls around the wall or along the ground — player 1’s job is to prevent that from becoming a shot. If player 1 fails, they should not hang around near the ball, they should rotate to position 3 and 2 should attempt to clear. A conveyor-belt of clearance attempts with the last player always staying down on the ground ready to deal with a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the attack you want two players on the attack and one ready to both defend against a counter-attack and also ready to attack if needs be. On the defence you want one player clearing the ball, one player ready to take over clearing the ball and one player in goal. And in both cases, whenever someone changes position, another player should rotate back to fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think in terms of hitting the ball once, then rotating back. Then the next player hits the ball and then rotates back and so on. So you’re either hitting the ball or getting in a position ready to hit the next ball. It’s not always true — there will be many times when it’s best to hit the ball multiple times. But thinking in those terms will improve your positioning and allow your team to play more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, when the enemy is in possession of the ball, the player in position 1 should &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; attack the ball, even if they can’t realistically expect to hit it. You don’t want the enemy to control the game, you don’t want to give them time and space to do what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want to do. You want to force them to hit the ball before they’re ready and before their team is in position. Player 1’s job, when the enemy is in possession, is to disrupt them and make them fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-a-pass-is-often-better-than-a-shot&quot;&gt;4. A pass is (often) better than a shot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re on the attack — not a counter-attack, that’s a different situation — against a prepared defence, it’s usually best not to go for a direct shot. This is likely to be saved and a good save is also a clearance. Well done, you just turned an offensive play into a defensive one. What you want to do is force the defence to move — pull them out of position so that your team can take a shot with a chance of actually going in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either pass to a team-mate, hit the ball against the back wall at an appropriate angle and speed or send the ball up high to force them to attempt a risky clear. Once the defence is out of position, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; go for the shot. You’ll often get several chances because an out-of-position defence don’t make good clearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-trust-your-team-mates&quot;&gt;5. Trust your team-mates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This relates to all of the above. One of the reasons the ball-chaser chases the ball is because they don’t trust their team-mates; they’re trying to win singlehandedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play your position &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; and trust your team-mates to play theirs. If you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; hit a ball but you know someone &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;, from their position, be able to hit it better, &lt;em&gt;leave it for them&lt;/em&gt;. Trust them to hit the balls they should, trust them to rotate when they should. They won’t always deserve that trust but you’ll still play better as a team than if you tried to do it all yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your team-mates will learn. In most situations it’ll be obvious what they did wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a team plays &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; it’s a beautiful thing. It makes the game seventeen times more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to win and that’s cool, that’s what the game’s about. But you win or lose as a team, so &lt;em&gt;play like you’re in a team&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll be more fun for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5089</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/5089/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/5089</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’d had my eye on 5089 and its forebears, 3089 and 4089, for the longest time but never got around to giving them a go. I was wary — they &lt;em&gt;sounded&lt;/em&gt; like exactly my kind of game but the rudimentary graphics were off-putting (crude graphics aren’t a problem in themselves — if the game is good I don’t care — but they sometimes evince a more general lack of care)  and I found it hard to believe that these games, made by a lone developer, could live up to their descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spotted 5089 on sale the other day and decided to take the plunge. So, &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; it live up to its description?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kinda does, yeah. The graphics even start to grow on you over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing this game pretty obsessively over the past few days, it’s even pushed Rocket League aside. It’s undeniably rough around the edges and in some ways crude and even basic. But it also demonstrates a profound understanding on the part of the developer as to why I, at least, play action RPGs in particular and games in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late 90s and early 00s saw several mainstream games that explored those qualities unique to, or at least particularly potent within, games: agency; meaningful, free choice; immersive, convincing worlds explored through a first-person perspective; emergence and deep, open-ended systems. Games like Half-Life, Deus Ex and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmw.org/&quot;&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; promised a bright future filled with rich, systemic worlds for us to explore and play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That future never came — those games still represent the high point of that notion of gaming and are still, in many important ways, unsurpassed. The focus shifted from PCs to consoles and first-person games became shallower, less systemic and far less emergent. Rather than providing direction through a universe of possibilities, the linear narrative became the whole point. First person action games started telling us &lt;em&gt;exactly what to do&lt;/em&gt; rather than asking us what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; wanted to do, telling us &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; story rather than giving us the tools to tell our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 feels like a response to all that. One person’s attempt to show us what we &lt;em&gt;could have had&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it no coincidence that 5089 reminds me of three games from that era and I’m going to talk about each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmw.org/&quot;&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Like Morrowind, 5089 is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. Its world feels alien, strange and mysterious. Not weird for the sake of weird — its strangeness is not opaque but the result of an imagined culture which the player can piece together and make sense of. This is the &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; weirdness of Morrowind, not the &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; weirdness of games with a superficially surreal art style. The weirdness of 5089, like that of Morrowind, is a &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt;, not a style. The culture of Xax, 5089’s world, is explorable through the mechanics of the game’s world, not through static text. We’re not just &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; that it is weird, we can see that it &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; in a weird way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/5089_bot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/5089_bot.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 mimics the way a high level Morrowind character moves so perfectly that I think it must be intentional. Your character can run &lt;em&gt;exremely&lt;/em&gt; fast, jump &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; high, has incredible air-control and can use momentum to run up steep slopes, even vertical ones. Effectively you can wall-run, but this isn’t a binary control — you don’t press a button to run up a wall for a limited time — it’s entirely physical. Instinctively pulling off acrobatic stunts is intoxicating, the sense of physical freedom delicious. Just moving through the world is a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrowind’s world was statically levelled — some areas were easy, some tough. A low-level player could, say, venture inside the Ghostgate and head towards Red Mountain but they had two choices — they either had to work to become strong enough to take on the enemies within or, alternatively, use the game’s systems in a clever way to give themselves an edge. Areas aren’t narratively gated — if you want to go see Dagoth Ur immediately after leaving the census office at Seyda Neen, you can, if you can find a way to survive. At any particular time you had the choice as to what level of challenge (and thus reward) you wanted — you didn’t have to work your way, linearly, through the easy stuff to get to the hard stuff. 5089 is structured such that the further you travel from your starting location the harder the enemies get so, again, you can choose your challenge. If you want to skip past all the level 5 stuff and head straight into a level 15 base, where there’ll be level 15 gear, you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Morrowind, gear in 5089 is augmented with a variety of buffs and bonuses which you can mix and match freely allowing you to tailor your character to be &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as you want. There are no level restrictions on gear and no skills to activate, there are just weapons, armour and tools. If you manage to get your hands on a level 20 gun then you can use it at any time. 5089 doesn’t have character levels, just skill points which are rewarded for completing quests and which can be spent at any time directly on what would in Morrowind be called your attributes — stamina, agility, melee, programming, guns, stealing and so on. This doesn’t work like Morrowind’s level-up-what-you-use system but the result is the same — a character that is good at &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you want them to be good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/5089_tower.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/5089_tower.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 doesn’t require balance in your approach to defining your character. It’s &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;. If you want to make an ultimate glass-cannon character designed &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; around sneaky back-stabs then you’re free to do that. You can break down gear to its components and then re-assemble it freely allowing you to choose &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the buffs you want. You are, like in Morrowind, encouraged to experiment and &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quests in 5089 are not contextualised by narrative as they were in Morrowind, they are &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; procedurally generated tasks which allow you to get skill points. There is no sense of moving through a hierarchy and developing relationships as there was in Morrowind nor is there anything like the same narrative or cultural richness — its the systemic, emergent aspects of Morrowind boiled down to their mechanical essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second game 5089 reminds me of is Deus Ex. Like Deus Ex, 5089 is about approaching the situation at hand with the tools you currently have and finding a way to &lt;em&gt;make that work&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about combining your abilities and equipment in clever ways to achieve your goal. Say you want to take over that enemy building because you want access to the gun shop on the top floor. You’re low on health though, and this area is a bit tough for you. The bottom floor is packed with enemies you’re in no condition to take on and you’re not a stealthy character so sneaking past them isn’t an option. But you notice a window on the top floor and you do have that teleport gun you looted from the last boss… maybe with some well timed jumps and a shot through that window… just maybe…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 forces you to get creative with what you have. Not because you’re &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; to go somewhere and given a selection of tools to use but because you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to and these are the tools you currently have. Beside your weapons and basic movement controls you have access to hoverboards, pilotable ships, teleportation guns, decoy guns, grappling hooks and quite probably other stuff I’ve forgotten or not yet encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneaking into enemy territory to capture a base, take down a headquarters or just to look around and sneakily use buildings has that same sense of being somewhere you don’t belong, somewhere hostile and forbidden, as sneaking into a secret research facility in Deus Ex. And you have the same choice between stealth, combat or any blend of the two, It’s reactive and emergent — when things go wrong, and they will, you have to deal with that. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; you deal with it will depend on where you are, what you’re doing and what you have access to. Sometimes you’ll improvise with the tools at your disposal in a clever way, sometimes you’ll retreat and return later when you’re stronger or better-supplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/5089_ship.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/5089_ship.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike both Morrowind and Deus Ex there’s no quick-saving. When you commit to an action, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; committing. If things spiral out of control and you die, you will respawn at the last safe place you set as home and possibly lose an item (including those equipped) from your inventory. It’s often a game of weighing up your options, strategising as to when to press your luck and when to retreat to safety with what you’ve gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third game is an odd one — Delta Force 2 from 1999. What Delta Force 2 got &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, in common with 5089, is terrain. Delta Force 2’s terrain was fractally generated and rendered with voxels making it far more fluid and &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; than terrain in other games of the time. Unlike in contemporary shooters where the terrain was just a playing surface on which the game took place, the terrain in Delta Force 2 was a &lt;em&gt;tool&lt;/em&gt; to be used by the player. Its ravines, gulleys, canyons, hills and plateaus each afforded tactical possibilities, making the landscape a mechanical part of the game, not just a backdrop. Delta Force 2’s terrain, like that of 5089, while organic, was never &lt;em&gt;convincing&lt;/em&gt; as such, never &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; — it wasn’t striving to look exactly like our own world, but it had a far more important quality; readability. The land was &lt;em&gt;knowable&lt;/em&gt; — as you learned to read it, you learned to recognise where there’d be a gulley, for example, without actually being able to see the gulley. The land &lt;em&gt;made sense&lt;/em&gt;, increasing its usefulness to the player, allowing it to be utilised in a skillful way. 5089’s terrain is far more extreme than that of Delta Force 2 with immense drops, overhangs, caves, cliffs, lakes and seas in unlikely and alien combinations, but it shares that readability, that &lt;em&gt;knowableness&lt;/em&gt; which makes it a useful part of the game’s mechanics rather than just a fantastical setting — a thing to be exploited for advantage rather than just, y’know, a surface to walk on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/22/Df2_terrain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not talked much about the specifics of 5089’s broader mechanics nor its narrative because, for those of us who enjoy games like this, discovering those things for ourselves is often part of the joy. I’ll lightly touch on all that in the following short paragraph so, if you’d rather discover all this yourself, skip over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 is set on a procedurally generated planet called Xax. Two robot factions, the gold and the violet, are vying for control of the planet in a seemingly endless and obviously pointless war. You are a member of the gold but you’re special in some way, the Master can’t seem to track you. It’s up to you to find out what’s going on. Killing a series of progressively harder bosses unlocks narrative events where you get to uncover Xax’s past and make decisions regarding its future. Your character gains strength through capturing enemy bases, attacking enemy headquarters and performing quests, none of which is mandatory, you can pick and choose what to engage with at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/5089_hq.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/5089_hq.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 is, to say the least, rough around the edges. It’s almost &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; edges and they’re not so much rough as sharp. Its graphics are rudimentary, its interface utterly clunky and it comes with all the down-sides of Java. It is, in a lot of ways, &lt;em&gt;basic&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the work of a single person and there are many places where that shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5089 is pretty much unique. A deeply systemic and emergent, first person, open-world action sandbox RPG. “Rough gem” doesn’t describe it because it’s both rougher and simultaneously more special than that implies — gems are fairly common, this is unique. It cuts right down to the nub of those games I’m reminded of — a lone developer can’t possibly hope to fill in all the narrative, structure and other niceties a large team can create, so they’ve concentrated on the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; of what made those games special, those things that are &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; to our medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve taken that essence, polished it, and held it up to ask: Why aren’t we making first person action games like this? What happened? What the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; are the mainstream studios &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an echo of the games we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have had, had things gone a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like your cup of tea then it’s &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; worth its price. And it’s currently on sale on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/414510/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rocket League</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Rocket-League/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Rocket-League</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rocket League is about the joy of motion and the satisfaction of interacting with physical objects. It’s instantly gratifying. Your first game will be &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; — six players just chasing the ball, tripping over each other in a desperate scramble to slam their car into it — but it will be &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the pleasure we get throwing a ball against a wall or balls of paper into a bin; the basic, animal joy of making something fly through the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, mechanically, a very simple game; each player gets a cuboid and they have to propel a sphere through a rectangle. The fluency and adroitness with which you control your cuboid is the entirety of the game. What starts off as a clumsy, disorganised struggle to hammer your car into the ball becomes, with time, an exquisite ballet of aerial passes, air dribbles and off-the-wall freestyle goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I say “with time”, I mean a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of it. I’m ~1000 hours in and the skill ceiling is nowhere in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A game of Rocket League feels like what we wish sports felt like — an idealised version of ball-sports. It’s what sports &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like they feel like in films or compilation videos of the “10 greatest shots/goals/hits/plays ever” — Rocket League feels like that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. It’s all the excitement, drama and &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; of sport without the filler, the down-time, the &lt;em&gt;boring bits&lt;/em&gt;. It’s that feeling of tracking a ball on its arc through the air and launching yourself at it at the exact right moment and angle to propel it into the goal boiled down to its essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the Platonic ideal of sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rocketleague_car.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rocketleague_car.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game has various modes; you can play online, cross-platform, with friends or strangers in ranked and unranked matches of up to eight players. The basic game is football in cars (or ‘Soccar’, as the game calls it), but there’s also Hoops, which is more like basketball, Snow Day, which is akin to ice hockey and the new Rumble mode which is like Rocket League brought to you by Acme — you get various power-ups like a boxing glove on a spring or a plunger on a rope. ‘Soccar’ is likely where you’ll spend most of your time, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car customisation is a fun aspect of the game. There are various unlocks and drops which allow you to personalise your car to your liking with paints, decals, aerial ornaments, wheels and, of course, hats. What’s the point of a car without a hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car models themselves — some of which are available as DLC but there are plenty in the base game to keep you happy — all have the same basic abilities; the same top speed and jump height and so on. They do have different hit-boxes though — some are taller, some are flatter, some are wider and so on. This has the side-effect, due to the game being so heavily physics-based, of influencing the turning circles of the cars — some will turn more tightly than others and thus feel slightly different to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rocketleague_gola.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rocketleague_gola.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linux port, which was a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time coming, is described as being in beta and has some known issues. It’s prone to the occasional crash (though I’ve had none in my ~10 hours since the Linux port dropped) and, at least on my proprietary Nvidia drivers, lacks anti-aliasing. Otherwise the port seems fine, I can’t compare to Windows as I’ve never run the game in Windows but it certainly compares favourably to Wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rocketleague_waste.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rocketleague_waste.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocket League is a perfect game — it gets what it is trying to do &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; right. It’s joyous to play and manages to be fun at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; skill levels (the game does a decent job of matching you with players of similar experience). It requires no knowledge going in — everyone knows how to hit a thing against another thing and make it fly — but provides an arena for you to learn, improve and hone your skills over thousands of hours if you so desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pure, distilled, concentrated fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rocket League is available for Linux from &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/rocket-league&quot;&gt;Humble Bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help get your dander up, here are the pros from the final of the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/&quot;&gt;RLCS&lt;/a&gt; tournament showing us what can be done with a flying car:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rimworld</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Rimworld/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Rimworld</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rimworld is a sci-fi colony management game set on the untamed frontier. The game’s devs cite Firefly and Dune as influences and it certainly shows — the worlds you’re colonising are wild and lawless, sparsely populated by tribes and other colonies, some of whom will be friendly and others decidedly not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major influence is, of course, Dwarf Fortress, from which Rimworld takes its approach to deep simulation — colonists have body parts and internal organs, psychological states and moods, relationships with other colonists and animals, needs, desires, prejudices and preferences and so on. The simulation is not &lt;em&gt;as deep&lt;/em&gt; as that of Dwarf Fortress — Rimworld doesn’t generate thousands of years worth of history, mythology, geological activity etc. — but it’s &lt;em&gt;deep enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, myself included, have been waiting for a decent &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress with a clicky GUI&lt;/em&gt; for a long time. There’ve been many attempts and they usually have the same failing; bad AI. When you do not have direct control over your colonists/gnomes/dwarfs (let’s call them ‘people’) it’s imperative that they do what you intended — you don’t want your people chopping wood when you just noticed winter is on its way and created a work order for coats. When you have the resources to make coats and you’ve created a work order for coats and, instead of making coats, your people all freeze to death chopping wood, that’s &lt;em&gt;frustrating&lt;/em&gt;. Your people died of &lt;em&gt;stupidity&lt;/em&gt; and it really wasn’t your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rimworld’s colonists are actually &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt;. It’s as if they, like you, &lt;em&gt;want to prosper&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;that feels good&lt;/em&gt;. Often they’ll even do pressing things before I realise they need doing, leaving me free to concentrate on the bigger picture, which is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what I want from a game like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rimworld is not &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress with a GUI&lt;/em&gt;, in some ways its less — nothing matches Dwarf Fortress in terms of the depth and breadth of simulation and the resulting emergence. But nor is it just &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress Lite&lt;/em&gt; — it’s very much its own thing and it brings its own ideas, notably the &lt;em&gt;AI Director&lt;/em&gt;, an idea borrowed from Left 4 Dead. The AI Director is an entity designed to generate interesting and, importantly, appropriate challenges for your particular colony at that particular time. You can choose from multiple personalities for this AI Director — the gradually escalating &lt;em&gt;Cassandra Classic&lt;/em&gt;, the more sedate &lt;em&gt;Phoebe Chillax&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Randy Random&lt;/em&gt; who is, well, random — which, combined with the game’s difficulty setting and a plethora of starting scenarios, cover the full gamut of players’ pacing preferences; from a hardcore roguelike survival experience to a relaxed game which emphasises management and growth over challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs describe Rimworld as a &lt;em&gt;story generator&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;RimWorld is not designed as a competitive strategy game, but as a &lt;strong&gt;story generator&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not about winning and losing - it’s about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it really does excel at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I’ll tell you a little about my current colony, &lt;em&gt;GNU Slash Hope&lt;/em&gt; (actual slashes weren’t allowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gnu-slash-hope&quot;&gt;GNU Slash Hope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My three colonists crash landed in their escape pods in a temperate forest region of the planet. Let’s meet them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rose, a 27 year old machine collector who grew up as a shelter child. She’s an unremarkable all-rounder but she does have the &lt;em&gt;Optimist&lt;/em&gt; trait which helps keep her spirits up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taiki, a 32 year old counsellor who grew up as a shopkeeper. He’s excellent at social interactions and pretty good at building and mining. He has the &lt;em&gt;Heat Tolerant&lt;/em&gt; trait, which is handy, and is also &lt;em&gt;Ascetic&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that lavish surroundings actually make him sad — perfect for me!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buchanan, a 38 year old herbalist who grew up, apparently, as a coma child. I got lucky with Buchanan, her growing skills meant I could grow a wide range of crops from the outset. She shares the &lt;em&gt;Ascetic&lt;/em&gt; trait with Taiki but is also &lt;em&gt;Abraisive&lt;/em&gt; which means she’ll always speak her mind and often piss people off doing so. I know how that feels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After emerging from their pods, my colonists gathered up the scant supplies that had survived the crash (some food, wood and steel) and began work on a temporary dormitory so they’d have somewhere sheltered to sleep. I decided, since wood is plentiful in this region, to use that as a building material. This is somewhat risky since fires are not uncommon but, since all my colonists are capable of firefighting, I chance it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rimworld_start.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rimworld_start.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin settling in — building a basic power grid and a refrigerated area for food — when a wanderer called Mitch joins us. Mitch is a not-very-bright sniper who grew up as a naturalist which seems to have given him a passion for growing things. He has the &lt;em&gt;Fast Walker&lt;/em&gt; trait, which is handy, so I put him to work in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time we experience the first of what will become many bandit attacks. My people, surprisingly, hold their own during the attack, quickly dealing with two attackers and scaring the third away. After the attack is over and my wounded are safely tucked into their medical beds I notice that one of the downed attackers, ‘Tomboy’, is still — barely — alive. I hastily build a small prison cell and tell my people to capture her in the hope that I can recruit her into the colony. Recruiting prisoners is difficult and time-consuming — the colonists occasionally chat with Tomboy and try to convince her to give up banditry and join our lovely settlement, but it has a very low chance of success. It’s also a drain on resources since we have to provide food and medical attention. We have good farmers though so food is plentiful and I decide it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Tomboy died in captivity sometime later, I’m not entirely sure why. Her death made Mitch very sad since he’d grown to like her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing’s up and running — we’re producing a decent crop of potatoes, healroot (which produces herbal medicine) and strawberries — so food is taken care of for now and I decide it’s time to build individual rooms for my colonists which should improve their mood somewhat — they like having their own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period we’re joined by two more colonists — Weiss, a 23 year old architect who grew up as a medical assistant and Leighton, a 47 year old defector who grew up as a refugee. Weiss was on the run from pirates and offered to join our colony if we fight them off, which we did. She’s my first colonist with any ability in research so I take her off most duties so she can concentrate on that. She’s an optimistic heat lover, which is good for me, but she’s psychically sensitive so I’ll have to keep an eye on her during any psychic anomalies. Leighton is skilled at combat, which is not much use to me since weaponry is limited, and not much else. I put him to work as a labourer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rimworld_growing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rimworld_growing.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things settle down and I expand the complex — nicer bedrooms for the colonists (being careful not to make them &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; nice for those with the ascetic trait), turning the old dormitory into a recreation area, creating an indoor storage room for goods that don’t do well out in the weather and I expand my fields so that we’re now producing corn and cotton alongside the potatoes, strawberries and healroot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since raids seem frequent here, I also expand the prison and make it a lot nicer — happy prisoners are less likely to want to escape — and we end up with three prisoners thanks to raids. Grasshopper has the nudist trait so I take her clothes which makes her &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; happier. Red eventually agrees to join us, she’s a healer — which is handy as the raids are often leaving my people needing medical attention — who grew up as a scavenger, an optimist who dreams of becoming bionic. She’s good at research and growing as well as medicine so I welcome her with open arms. Grasshopper and Rodaballo escape some time later and I decide not to pursue. Neither had great skills so I decide it’s not worth risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things tick along nicely, the odd raid aside. I expand storage and create a second refrigerated area for food. Thanks to my researchers, we gain the ability to cut stone and make carpets, so I expand the workshops. We don’t have access to much in the way of defenses yet but I build sandbags in strategic locations as cover for my colonists. We’re well fed and clothed and a calm period ensues with plenty of down-time to keep my colonists happy. During this period, Rose and Taiki become lovers and eventually get married. Buchanan’s abrasiveness keeps bubbling over and occasional fist fights break out between her and Rose as well as Mitch and Taiki, all four are frequent guests in the infirmary. On one occasion I saw Mitch beat the shit out of Taiki, then carry him to an infirmary bed and treat his wounds, feed him and then keep him company until sleep came. It’s nice to see that they can put their grievances aside after clearing the air. What’s life without a little conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things we’re lacking. Firstly, we don’t have a decent cook which means we can only produce the most basic meals. Secondly, we don’t have anyone with any animal training skills to speak of which means we’re missing out on all those delicious tortoise eggs, that muffalo milk, lovely alpaca wool and so on. Also there’s a giant sloth wandering around that looks like it would be pretty handy in a fight. What our colony &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needs is a giant mega guard-sloth. We’re well clothed, though — all that cotton has been turned into stylish cowboy hats, dusters, shirts and trousers. We’re &lt;em&gt;looking good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hum drum routine of colony life is broken by another bandit raid and this one might actually be a problem, there are five attackers and they’re far better armed than my colonists — they have SMGs and sniper rifles, we have two bolt action rifles, two pistols and a couple of bows. I quickly gather my colonists into defensive positions behind sandbags and wait for the attack. We manage to kill two bandits and down a third, but four of my people are hospitalised with severe wounds. I tend to my wounded and capture the downed bandit. Rose is left with a shattered rib, Taiki loses his left index finger and Red loses the big toe of her left foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new prisoner, Emily, fares worse. We shot her left leg off during the attack and, after recovering from her wounds, she’s left immobile. I decide to task Mitch with operating on her to install a peg leg. He fumbles the operation the first time, but, once she’s re-recovered manages to install the peg leg on the second try. Emily, a space pirate who grew up as an apocalypse survivor, quickly joins us. She doesn’t have much in the way of skills outside of combat but I have a soft spot for her — she’s been through a lot. She has the &lt;em&gt;Jealous&lt;/em&gt; trait which means she gets unhappy if she doesn’t have the nicest bedroom. This makes me laugh and I start planning a lavish, carpeted bedroom, furnished with the finest tables and chairs we can make and decorated with Buchanan’s — frankly shitty — wooden sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily is exactly the kind of misfit we welcome at GNU Slash Hope, the future’s looking good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/rimworld_future.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/rimworld_future.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rimworld is great. I’ve been waiting for a game like this for a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time. It deftly avoids the genre’s common pitfalls and introduces a few innovative flourishes of its own. The AI Director, combined with flexible, extensive difficulty and starting scenario settings allows it to cater to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the people who might want to play a game like this, from the hardcore right through to the casual. It’s amazing to think that this is only the beginning — it feels like a finished game — I can’t wait to see where it goes in the future. This is not just &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress with a GUI&lt;/em&gt;; it does scratch that itch, but this is its own thing with its own identity. It feels like a classic in the making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rimworld is available via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rimworldgame.com/&quot;&gt;dev’s website&lt;/a&gt; and also on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hyper Light Drifter</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Hyper-Light-Drifter/"/>
   <updated>2016-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Hyper-Light-Drifter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are lots of pretty looking indie games around but, often, the beauty is superficial. Pretty pictures on top of what is barely a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyper Light Drifter is beautiful &lt;em&gt;all the way down&lt;/em&gt;. Its gorgeous aesthetics are married with intelligent, inventive game design choices throughout. Each aspect of the game’s design speaks in unison with all others — this isn’t a jam session, it’s a symphony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of music, the game’s soundtrack is, without hyperbole, &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;. I usually end up turning music off in games; even when I like it it begins to grate through repeition. The music in Hyper Light Drifter, like everything else in the game, just fits so perfectly — &lt;em&gt;is so much a part of the environment&lt;/em&gt; — that I wouldn’t dream of disabling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_ledge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_ledge.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment is very important, the world of Hyper Light Drifter feels like a place with history and culture. It’s mysterious, as an alien culture should be, and exposition is understated to say the least — nothing is spelled out, the only text I’ve encountered has been in the UI — it just exists, out there, for you to explore, unravel and decipher. The game communicates what it wants you to do through silent vignettes and a symbolic language; it &lt;em&gt;shows&lt;/em&gt; you, it doesn’t tell. It’s up to you to work out the semiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attention to communication flows through the game — you’re never told too much, just enough that you can work it out if you choose to, but all the information is there. Locations and enemies are readable, you get a sense of what might be a hazard, how enemies might act, where a secret might be and so on from visual and kinetic clues. But you’re expected to do the work to piece it together, you are not led around by the hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyper Light Drifter &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; you to explore, to get lost, hit dead ends and work out how to get past them. As with the best of RPGs I always have a task in mind, then get distracted by something intriguing &lt;em&gt;over there&lt;/em&gt;. And then get distracted by something else and then struggle to recall what it was I was actually trying to accomplish an hour or so ago. I’ve not finished the game yet — I want to take my time and explore every single corner of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_town.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_town.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat is the meat of the game and it’s frustrating and satisfying in that perfect mix. Fights are hectic and kinetic but — importantly — controlled, it’s when you lose that control — mis-timing a hit, messing up your chain-dodge, mis-reading an enemy, dodging over a ledge — that you will die. It’s very unforgiving, punishing even, but never unfair; if you fight &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;, you will win. Combat is about watching your enemies, learning how they move and when they hit and then dodging and hitting them accordingly. It’s challenging and rewarding in that way we all remember from older games, relying on skill and excellent controls, rather than protecting players from any failure as more modern games too often do — it’s hard to feel satisfaction when you can’t really lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your tools in combat are your sword and your dodge (and your wits). You also have a pistol which fills with bullets as you hit stuff and, later, grenades. These weapons can all be upgraded in various ways as you progress through the game — you can upgrade your dodge such that you can, with precision timing, chain dodges together, for example — but your tool set remains simple and elegant. You don’t get more powerful through upping the damage numbers on your weapons, you do so by learning to use them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reluctant to talk too much about this game, it’s so much about the joy of exploration and learning the game’s languages and mechanics that too much description would only detract from the experience should you choose to play it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_cute.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hyper_light_drifter_cute.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful, thoughtful game which does not compromise the integrity of its design at any point, resulting in a sprawling but coherent world, begging to be explored and deciphered, and offering challenge and reward in that perfect mix at all levels. The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; caveat to my otherwise unreserved recommendation is that the game is capped at 30fps, and I know that really bothers some people. I would’ve preferred it to run at 60 because why not but, due to its art style and animation, I honestly barely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyper Light Drifter is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hyper-light-drifter&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/hyper_light_drifter&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart-machine.com/&quot;&gt;Dev’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my pal Hex using his extraordinary skills to somehow show us this game through some sort of moving pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Duskers</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Duskers/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Duskers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine someone took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack&quot;&gt;Nethack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/268500/&quot;&gt;XCOM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/&quot;&gt;FTL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt; and mixed them all together somehow in a way that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds good? Well, that’s Duskers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;## END TRANSMISSION ##&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since “end transmission” doesn’t seem to do anything in HTML, I’ll continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duskers has you as the pilot of a spaceship in a universe where &lt;em&gt;something’s gone badly wrong&lt;/em&gt;. As a lonely survivor of whatever-it-is-that-happened, your task is to survive. And, if you manage that, to find out what happened to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You move your ship through a graveyard of derelict space craft, docking with those you like the look of in search of fuel, scrap, technology and clues, in the occasional (beautifully written) un-corrupted log, as to what’s going on. You do not explore these ships directly but through the sensors of a team of up to four drones that you control via a command-line interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones —  each of which gets, by default, a human name to make &lt;em&gt;absolutely sure&lt;/em&gt; you grow attached to them — each have up to four modules which are, essentially, skills they can use during excursions. Modules are salvaged from destroyed drones you find while exploring ships and can be swapped between drones and upgraded, with scrap, to be more powerful or useful. Modules allow drones to do a variety of things like defend themselves, interface with ship systems, detect and avoid enemies and move salvage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command-line interface — which is lovely and Unixy, great for Linux users (you can even create aliases) — requires you to control the bots through typed commands. You can, while boarded with another ship, switch between two views — a tactical overview which represents the ship as a series of rooms, doors and systems and a drone view which, from a top-down, third-person perspective shows you what the selected drone can see and allows you to move it around with the cursor keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/duskers_hal.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duskers_hal.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll spend most of your time in the overview giving your bots commands, which take the form of actions combined with objects, and can be strung together with semicolons. So, for example, say I wanted drone 1 and 3 to move into room 2, drone 3 to use its generator to power the ship’s systems and drone 1 to interface with the terminal in that room (their respective modules allow them to do these things), then I wanted to open door 2, which would now be powered, and move drone 3 into room 3 and to collect anything it finds there. I could enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; navigate 1 3 r2; generator; interface; d2; navigate 3 r3; gather all
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airlocks are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;an&lt;/code&gt; (where n is a number), doors are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dn&lt;/code&gt;, rooms are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rn&lt;/code&gt; and drones are just the numbers &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1-4&lt;/code&gt; (you can use their names if you prefer). To open doors (so long as they’re powered) you only have to type their name, which will toggle them (you can do &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;d2 open/close&lt;/code&gt; if you prefer). Modules are activated by typing their names. If more than one drone has a particular module you’ll need to specify which drone to use with, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generator 1&lt;/code&gt;. All commands will tab-complete so executing orders is more about thinking and planning than it is a typing test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/duskers_alias.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duskers_alias.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is a game &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; about thinking and planning. The derelict ships you explore are home to a variety of hazards in the form of automated defenses and various aliens, all of which will quickly disable or destroy your drones given the chance. Fighting is not a viable strategy — even if you win (and in my experience you won’t) it will be too expensive — your objective is to conserve and gather resources, combat is wasteful. Instead you must outsmart your enemy — using modules to detect and watch them, making educated guesses as to their movements and behaviours and either luring them where you want them while you explore other rooms or sneaking past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’ll be long pauses while you consider your next move (it’s not turn-based but it has that feel). I’ll sometimes walk away from my PC to have a think about the current situation — it’s one of those games. This need for consideration extends to drone’s loadouts — do you want the drone with stealth to also have the motion sensor? Or the lure? Should the interface drone be the one to do gathering and towing? There are decisions to make all the time and they will all play slightly differently, affecting the options you have during excursions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/duskers_tactical.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duskers_tactical.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universe is a lonely place, what with everyone else being dead. The utilitarian aesthetics of the interface design when controlling the ship between salvage missions suggests mundanity; this isn’t the exciting space of Star Wars or even Star Trek, it was, until whatever happened happened, our normal, everyday world where we did our job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During boardings it feels different. The mundanity remains — these are lived in spaces where people got on with their lives — but deserted they’re eerie, foreboding and claustrophobic. And &lt;em&gt;dangerous&lt;/em&gt; — the enemies in this game do not fuck around and, at least early on, if you’re spotted, that’s it, you may as well start over. You’ll know the enemies are there from the start but you don’t know &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a tense game of distraction, deduction and sneaking where one wrong move is enough to end your run. This is the space of Alien or 2001. You hear the weird creaks and groans of decaying structures through your drone’s sensors and share their restricted, imperfect view of what’s around them. On the tactical view you see the red lines that tell you there’s something bad &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; in that next room and you notice the air vent in the current room. Do you come up with a plan for pressing on or do you call it quits and get out with what you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duskers is in a fundamental way free from abstraction. By which I mean, like other games which simulate interacting with a computer interface, if you were doing the thing the game depicts rather than playing the game, there would be no difference. Your screen would look the same and you’d be doing the same stuff; peering at your screen and typing things in. Rather than being slightly removed from the game’s narrative you’re &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; in it and, instead, slightly removed from your drones. And you &lt;em&gt;depend&lt;/em&gt; on your drones, you literally need them to survive. They are your companions and partners and the closest thing to anything with a personality (projected as it may be) in your universe. You &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about them. That combination of caring, distance and imperfect control is what makes Duskers so utterly tense, so devastating when things go wrong and rewarding when you get it right. There’s very little RNG here, beyond the procedurally generated environments; if you fail it was your fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fail so hard that you may as well restart you can “reset”, which starts you off again from the beginning. If you don’t like how a particular excursion went you can quit out of it and you will be reverted to the state you were in before you boarded, but you will not be able to re-board that particular ship. I like this, it’s a smart compromise — permadeath can be overly punishing sometimes, especially in a game which relies so heavily on learning from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/duskers_navigate.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/duskers_navigate.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was sick of roguelikes but Duskers has disabused me of that, I think I was just sick of mediocre ones. Duskers is a clever, beautiful, &lt;em&gt;surprising&lt;/em&gt; game in a crowded, tired genre (if a genre it is). It’s one of those games where you’ll know whether you’d like it just from the description, if it’s as good as it sounds. &lt;em&gt;It is&lt;/em&gt;. I recommend it as firmly as I recommend getting your drones the fuck out of rooms with air-vents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duskers is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/254320/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s currently on sale, &lt;a href=&quot;http://duskers.misfits-attic.com/&quot;&gt;the developers’ website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/duskers&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/duskers&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;## SIGNAL LOST ##&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still here? Ok, fine, here’s a video of my pal Hex playing some Duskers on Linux:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shadwen</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Shadwen/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Shadwen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shadwen is getting a bit of kicking from reviewers and I’m here to tell you why they’re all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the fundamental problem is that the devs are presenting Shadwen as a stealth game. It really isn’t. I get the feeling that fans of games like Thief, Deux Ex, Dishono(u)red and so on are buying this, expecting a similar experience, and feeling disappointed when they get something else. Reviewers, too, seem to be treating it as a straightforward stealth game and judging it in that context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxonomics&quot;&gt;Taxonomics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs aren’t doing themselves any favours. Here’s the game’s description on Steam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shadwen is a stealth-action game where the only rule is to remain unseen. Stay hidden - or the ruthless guards will kill you on sight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of that is strictly &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;, but it gives entirely the wrong impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadwen is a puzzle game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like a Stealth game and, yes, you will spend the game avoiding and distracting and perhaps even murdering guards. But it’s only a stealth game insomuch as Portal is an FPS — you have a gun, you shoot your gun and it’s in first person so it’s &lt;em&gt;quite clearly&lt;/em&gt; a first person shooter, right? No, not in anything but the strictest taxonomical sense. It &lt;em&gt;feels and plays&lt;/em&gt; like a puzzle game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same is true of Shadwen. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a puzzle game. One that operates within the language of a stealth game, undoubtedly, retaining the tension and drama of that genre, but the thoughts you have while playing are puzzle game thoughts. It’s a puzzle game &lt;em&gt;applied&lt;/em&gt; to the narrative and mechanical space of a stealth game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadwen_look.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadwen_look.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-a-path&quot;&gt;Making a path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing as the eponymous &lt;em&gt;Shadwen&lt;/em&gt; you must clear a path through levels for your companion, a young girl called Lilly, who will only move between hiding places when the path is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reviews I’ve read have characterised this as elevating an escort mission to be the central mechanic of the game. This is really not the case since all the irritations we normally associate with escort missions are absent. Lilly doesn’t even follow you, not really, she merely moves through the level, entirely of her own volition, as the path is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no hand-holding or guiding here — the two of you act entirely independently. Shadwen herself will usually be up high, on rooftops and platforms, while Lilly scurries between safe havens down in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those streets are &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, this is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pretty game. Locations are interesting and full of character while also seeming plausible, they have a lovely fairytale quality while also feeling grounded and real. Streets are dingy and worn but never drab, the feeling is that of a beautiful town suffering hard times and, as you move higher, the wan, melancholic sunlight suggests &lt;em&gt;just enough&lt;/em&gt; warmth and hope. The aesthetic throughout the game evinces a subtle, skillfully understated art direction which stands in stark contrast to Frostbyte’s previous games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadwen_above.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadwen_above.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadwen has a couple of tools at her disposal; a dagger and a grappling hook, with more craftable as the game progresses. The grappling hook, as you’d expect, allows Shadwen to climb up high and swing between platforms and poles but also allows her to pull objects, which is handy for distracting guards. Clearing a path for Lilly involves either killing or distracting all the guards in her immediate path such that she’ll move from one hiding place to the next. If Lilly sees violence, including the corpses of your victims, she will comment on it and this will, the game tells me, impact the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviews have criticised the game for being too easy and I agree that it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be; &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to follow the path of least resistance. The game is far more interesting if you challenge yourself to play in a particular way. I’m currently trying to play the game without doing any violence (which is unusual for me, I’m a big fan of killing guards — they chose the wrong side, after all — air vents and bushes are usually overflowing with my victims) because it’s a far more fun challenge. Afterwards it’s my intention to play through again, killing every single guard, but without Lilly ever seeing any evidence of it. These, to me, seem to be the two interesting ways to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop&quot;&gt;Stop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far this sounds like a stealth game, right? What makes Shadwen different is that time only moves when you move, which immediately creates what feel like turns. You might think that this would remove any sense of tension or urgency from the game but that’s not the case, what it does instead is make each moment more meaningful — rather than getting caught because you couldn’t move your fingers fast enough, you get time to think, to plan your next move, extending the moment and making it about thinking rather than dexterity with what are, in every game, imperfect controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time can also be rewound at any point which, again, you’d be forgiven for thinking would lead to a lack of challenge. When the punishment for failure in most games is reloading a checkpoint or quicksave then I’m more than fine with this mechanic — you still feel bad, you still feel like you failed, but you are not further punished for forgetting to quicksave for half an hour or forced to redo the bit between the last checkpoint and where you are now over an over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadwen_corridor.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadwen_corridor.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mechanics are liberating, allowing you to try riskier stuff without fear of the &lt;em&gt;artificial&lt;/em&gt; punishment of repetition. They encourage &lt;em&gt;creativity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;experimentation&lt;/em&gt;. I’ll often rewind time not because I failed, but because I think I can do that section &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or with more &lt;em&gt;elegance&lt;/em&gt; or just in a more amusing way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a game for those people who like to be told exactly what to do and how to do it, it’s a game for those of us who like setting our own goals and really &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; a game rather than just gaming it. A game that requires a bit of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadwen is &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a stealth game, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; feel sneaky and stealthy as you make your way around and over guards, leaping between rooftops undetected or creeping behind their backs. But, more than that, Shadwen is very much a puzzle game. It’s a game for people who like to stop and think and work stuff out. Then try stuff, fail, and re-think. It’s not quite like anything I’ve played before and it’s a game that gives you more the more you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/shadwen_sun.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadwen_sun.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a game to play &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; as much as just simply play through. And a very very pretty one at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its current price, with 15% off for launch on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/425210/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an absolute leaping-across-rooftops-and-pulling-a-crate-over-to-distract-you steal. It’s also available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/shadwen&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stellaris</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Stellaris/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Stellaris</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stellaris represents a determined effort on the part of Paradox to take what people love about Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV — the complexity and emergence, the intrigue, the &lt;em&gt;weirdness&lt;/em&gt; and the sense of telling your own story — and bring it to a wider audience by making it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough thing to do as, to a great extent, what made those games difficult to approach was also what, further down the line, made them interesting. Can Paradox really simplify something like that without compromising its fundamental identity and losing what it essentially &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short; yeah they can and have. But of course it’s a little more complicated than that …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/stellaris_fleet.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stellaris_fleet.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Launch every beetleship&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradox’s task was to cut away needless complexity while retaining that which had real ludic purpose. The UI illustrates their success in this regard; it’s no longer the bewildering cacophony of icons, numbers and text we grew to love in EU and CK, it’s far better organised and does a good job of communicating not just what things &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; but what they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. With CKII and EUIV I had to watch tens of hours of videos before I could even begin to play, with Stellaris I just dove right in and things made perfect sense — I even turned off the tutorial tips after about 20 minutes as they were unnecessary and kept talking at me when I was trying to read other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellaris sits &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; on the boundary between grand strategy and 4X, incorporating the best aspects of those two styles of strategy game. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; simpler than its historically-based Paradox siblings but it’s far more complex and interesting than, say, Civilization V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cockroach&quot;&gt;Cockroach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s start where &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; good stories start: with a race of space-faring cockroaches bent on dominating the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stellaris_cockroach.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the &lt;em&gt;Sky Hive&lt;/em&gt;. A race of xenophilic, pacifistic spiritual cockroaches intent, under my guidance, on conquering the galaxy. Or maybe not so much conquering it as friending it into submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love good  character creation systems. I can spend hours in them. The race creation system in Stellaris was pure joy for me, with plenty of options to allow me to make a race that I really felt was &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, without being overwhelmed with pointlessly superficial choices. There’s a nice balance between cosmetic and meaningful stuff and the system as a whole entices you to role-play despite yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with my pal &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MatthewJFrith&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; as we both launched the game for the first time and, while neither of us usually tend to role-play in games, we just couldn’t help doing so in Stellaris — me with my hippy cockroaches and him with his racist bird aesthetes who just want to collect all the beautiful things (and people) in the galaxy and bring them back to their celestial nest. Neither of us set out with the intention of creating a race like that, the race creator just &lt;em&gt;invites&lt;/em&gt; it, encouraging investment right from the start and ensuring that no two playthroughs are going to be quite the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traits and governmental systems are what really define the character of your race — you get a limited number of trait points to spend on traits, each of which have a moderate and extreme form. Traits are arranged in a circle with those on opposite sides also being philosophically opposed, like xenophilia and xenophobia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planetfall&quot;&gt;Planetfall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellaris is a strategy game and is, ultimately, about going out into space and controlling planets. You start off with one planet and, based on which FTL propulsion technology you choose during race creation, will be able to travel to a limited number of other star systems. You choose, during character creation, what type of planets your race will be most comfortable on (other types become habitable through tech) and you colonise them by sending out a colony ship, assuming they’re not occupied. If they are occupied then you’ll want to do something about that and there are various tools at your disposal with that aim in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planets have, as is usual for spacey strategyey games, a number of slots, determined by planet size, for building things in. Some slots have bonus resources which can be exploited through the usual mines, research facilities, farms and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a distinct, but not overwhelming, Star Trek vibe to proceedings. You’ll likely begin the game by sending out science ships to scan heavenly bodies, looking for resources and possible locations for colonies. They’ll encounter and research various anomalies along the way, make first contact with other civilisations and run into giant space amoebas, space whales, crystalline entities and beings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijAYN9zVnwg&quot;&gt;pure energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/stellaris_spacewhale.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stellaris_spacewhale.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Arm photons&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/azuresama/&quot;&gt;Becca&lt;/a&gt; once described Crusader Kings II as “the best Interactive Fiction”. I thought that was pretty insightful and it applies equally to Stellaris — the story of your game is defined in large part by random encounters with anomalies and lifeforms which are presented, as they are in other Paradox strategy games, as lovely textual vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-friends&quot;&gt;Making friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you expand out into the galaxy you will meet other races. Some will be relatively primitive and, depending on your empire’s laws, may be used, abused or helped in various ways. Others will be, like you, taking their first steps into a wider world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/stellaris_spacefriends.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stellaris_spacefriends.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;When neighbours become good friends &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kIdFzP0TJxc?t=4&quot;&gt;♬&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy is more accessible than in previous Paradox games, without the huge lists of conditional interactions, but no less flexible or nuanced for it. Your interactions with other races will be characterised by your race’s traits, as will theirs. Everything from all out war through trade, access and research agreements to the formation of alliances and, ultimately, federations, is possible. Primitive cultures can be aided, subjugated, enslaved and annexed as is only proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the early exploration phase of the game is wonderful, this is where the real meat is. Stellaris, like its siblings, is not so much about simply gaining territory — that’s the easy part — it’s about holding it together once you have it. Managing pressures from within and without, choosing relationships, picking sides, allocating resources and choosing where to attack and when. It’s about getting as much information as possible and then making the best judgement you can with the information you have. Knowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj4nJ1YEAp4&quot;&gt;when to hold ‘em, when to fold ‘em, when to walk away and when to run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleet management and warfare are simplified compared to those other games which I’ve already mentioned too much. The interface design is smarter and it’s much easier to accomplish what you want to get done. It’s really just a matter of selecting your ships and telling them where to go. There are nice convenience touches, like when a science ship is done researching an anomaly it encountered mid-journey it will carry on with its previously assigned tasks without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admirals, generals, scientists and, depending on your politics, leaders can be recruited from a pool and assigned to various vessels, colonies and tasks in much the same way as in previous games. They will level up and gain traits as they gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is presented in a much more interesting — and understandable — way than in previous games. Each time you research a technology you will be presented with a finite selection (three choices in my current game but this can be increased) of technologies to research next — the technology tree is never explicitly presented to the player, you just choose what to research next. I like this approach as it prevents, or at least delays, the weird teleological feel these games sometimes have when you’re deciding in 3000 BCE that you’d like to steer your research towards nuclear fusion or whatever. Additional technologies can be unlocked through your encounters in the game; you might learn through your interaction with some space monster how to develop defensive flagella or regenerative hulls, for example. Research is divided into three categories — physics, society and engineering — each of which are treated separately, meaning you don’t have to choose between them, they are researched in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;boldly-claiming&quot;&gt;Boldly claiming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers of Stellaris identified, and attempted to fix, a problem common to most strategy games: they become &lt;em&gt;very dull&lt;/em&gt; during the late game. Usually it’s clear who’s going to win well before the end and the final portion of the game — which can be many tens of hours of gameplay in games like this — is just a matter of everyone going through the motions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellaris introduces momentous late-game events which can have dramatic, possibly cataclysmic, outcomes on empires. Say you developed robots to the point of sentience but used them as slaves within your empire. Perhaps they’ll rise up in revolt, causing chaos and forcing you to give up any external ambitions and focus inwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this approach works is yet to be seen. It’s going to depend on the events being sufficiently emergent and diverse and, most importantly, not just seeming unfair — if they manage to make it feel like chickens coming home to roost in a bed that you made then it could indeed bring much needed, but fair, unpredictability and dynamism to the late game. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; right to me, but I’ve not played enough to be certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space-conclusions&quot;&gt;Space conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Stellaris. Paradox have found a nice sweet spot between grand strategy and 4X and parked their game right in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect, my main criticism being that it’s not &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; enough. There’s weirdness in there, but it doesn’t feel as gloriously, surprisingly odd as its siblings can be at times. A lesser issue is that while the devs have done an amazing job with the interface, making intelligent and for the most part successful choices as to what to cut and what to leave in, there are a few areas where I’d like to have a little more complexity and be presented with a little more information. Map modes, for example, would be useful on the galactic map — not as many as CKII and EUIV have, that would be overwhelming — but it’d be handy to see who’s allied with whom and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are small issues. Paradox have done a stunning job in making an accessible grand strategy game. They’ve made smart choices as to what to keep in and what to leave out and the result is a game with surprising complexity and depth given how accessible it is. I’m &lt;em&gt;absolutely certain&lt;/em&gt; that this game will get both better and &lt;em&gt;more interesting&lt;/em&gt; over time as Paradox follow their usual practise of substantially updating and revising their games after launch with both free patches and paid DLC. I’m also certain that the community will mod it beyond all recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellaris isn’t a game that’s trying to impress you with its technical fidelity but there’s a quiet, understated beauty to the graphics which is echoed in the simple elegance of the UI, the beautiful music and dazzlingly gorgeous artwork throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/stellaris_pulsar.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/stellaris_pulsar.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A pulsar showing off&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love what Stellaris is at release and I’m excited to see where the devs and modders take it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stellaris is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris&quot;&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to thank Paradox for their continued, &lt;strong&gt;flawless &lt;em&gt;day one&lt;/em&gt; Linux support&lt;/strong&gt; then I’d suggest buying it via their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris&quot;&gt;Paradox Plaza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SUPERHOT</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/SUPERHOT/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/SUPERHOT</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need to get this out of the way at the start: SUPERHOT is &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m partial to constructivist and suprematist art so maybe I’m influenced by that — the explosions of red polygons, the solid black weapons and white ground make screenshots look like artworks by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rodchenko&quot;&gt;Rodchenko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Lissitzky&quot;&gt;Lissitzky&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich&quot;&gt;Malevich&lt;/a&gt; — but this game really is aesthetically stunning. There’ve been times when I’ve died because I was so distracted by the beauty of the scene before me that I failed to notice the bullet about to enter my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUPERHOT is a first person shooter with the central conceit that time only moves when you do (which isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; true, time moves very very slowly when you’re stationary) allowing the player to pull off some crazy John Woo-esque moves that wouldn’t be possible in a normal shooter. Punch a man in the face, grab his gun from the air as he drops it, shoot him with his own gun, turn 180°, throw the gun in the air and punch the man who was behind you in the face after side-stepping the bullet he just fired, turn to your left and catch the gun you threw, shoot the man to your left and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FPS is transformed into something between turn based combat and a puzzle game without losing the raw excitement of second-to-second first person combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/superhot_constructivist.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/superhot_constructivist.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;After you've been playing for a while you'll swear that screenshots are moving slowly&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple mechanic but it’s artfully executed; animations are fluid, physical and weighty — it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; good as you perform superhuman feats — and the intent of your AI opponents is evident from their posture and movement. The sparse aesthetic, aside from just looking gorgeous, keeps the game readable — visual confusion would’ve spoiled the flow. Combat sounds have a pleasantly chunky feel to them and attenuate wonderfully as you speed up and slow down time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUPERHOT has something like a story; it’s more of a meta-narrative with shades of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/221910/&quot;&gt;Stanley Parable&lt;/a&gt; (though far less extreme) and The Matrix to it. I wouldn’t quite call it a narrative — nothing is really expounded, developed or resolved, it’s more like flavour text and I like it all the more for that. This meta-narrative is mainly delivered through the glitchy faux text-based OS that constitutes the game’s menu system and comprises IMs, IRC-like chats and mini-games (most of which are optional). I’m not usually a fan of superfluous narrative in action games but I enjoyed the meta-narrative of SUPERHOT; it’s not deep, but it’s intriguing, sometimes amusing and, a couple of times, pleasantly disturbing. It augments the action, adding a slight emotional layer, without distracting from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/superhot_ouch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/superhot_ouch.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;SUPER. HOT. SUPER. HOT.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main story/campaign of SUPERHOT will only take you a couple of hours to complete. It took me about three and a half and I’m &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve seen complaints about this but I think they miss the point — completing the main campaign unlocks the rest of the game and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is where the real meat is — the main campaign is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; just an extended tutorial. I’ll happily play the same level for hours, trying to beat my score or complete a challenge or challenging myself to play in a particular way (fists and thrown-things only, for example). If you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; enjoy that sort of gameplay then I’d look elsewhere since that’s the game this is — you’re intended to replay and refine, it’s very much a toy to be played &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; as well as being a game to play &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/superhot_system.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/superhot_system.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It's the most innovative shooter I've played in years&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I do hope the developers add more content. There’s enough here to keep me busy honing my superhuman ninja combat skills for quite a while, but there will definitely come a time when I want more. More maps and possibly more weapons to play with too. It feels like the sort of game that could be expanded upon for a long time and grow into something even more special than it already is, I hope the devs take that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is going to be my go-to relaxation game for a while, I think. I recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUPER. HOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, it’s beautiful.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUPERHOT is available for Linux on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gog.com/game/superhot&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video I made of a few minutes of Endless Mode gameplay:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>OpenVPN for Gaming</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/OpenVPN/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/OpenVPN</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m no expert, certainly not in networking, so this isn’t so much a &lt;strong&gt;HowTo&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;HowIDid&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll show you how I set up OpenVPN to allow my friends and I to play old ass games that only work on LAN (in our case, &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/4540/&quot;&gt;Titan Quest&lt;/a&gt; and a spot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/2990/&quot;&gt;FlatOut 2&lt;/a&gt;, both via Wine in my case, of course). This solution works for games which rely on UDP broadcast (i.e. games where you can’t just enter a direct IP, you have to look for games on the local network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preamble&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that this approach will expose your entire local network to any clients you invite. They will be able to see any shared resources on your local network — essentialy it’ll be as if they are connected directly to your LAN. This is only for use with friends whom you trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use any security measures you like, you don’t have to use keys. I’ll be using keys though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be using the same keys for all clients. This isn’t generally advised since if one of them leaks their key then, in order to remain secure, you’ll need to revoke and replace the key for everyone. In a big organisation this would be a terrible idea but for a handful of friends I think it’s easier to just have one key for all of them. Which approach you take is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used netctl to make the bridge since it seemed simplest. You can use any method you like but I’ll only be covering netctl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using Arch so examples will be Arch-centric and I’ll be using Systemd to manage services, adjust to taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenVPN installed, obviously. It’ll be in your repos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rsa-tools to generate the keys. Again, check your repos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wired internet connection on the server machine (I believe it’s possible to bridge a wifi connection but it’s more complicated so you’re on your own with that).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the machine you’re going to use as the server has a dynamic external IP then use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=free%20dynamic%20dns&quot;&gt;dynamic DNS service&lt;/a&gt; to get yourself a hostname that people can connect on, otherwise you’re going to have to give your clients new configs every time your IP changes. If you have a static IP then you can just use that if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some friends to test it’s working.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hedgewars.org/download.html&quot;&gt;Hedgewars&lt;/a&gt; — handy for testing. Throw up a LAN game and see if others can see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-the-keymaster&quot;&gt;I am the keymaster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make an assload of keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Create_a_Public_Key_Infrastructure_Using_the_easy-rsa_Scripts&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; exactly so there’s no point repeating them here, they’re excellent instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only changes I made were to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; where the example uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;elmer&lt;/code&gt; and to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; where the example uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/code&gt;. So when generating keys for my server, in the common name field, I used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; and when generating the client keys I used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; for the common name. If you want to stay matched up with me then do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you fill in the defaults in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vars&lt;/code&gt; file, just put sensible things in each of the following fields: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KEY_COUNTRY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KEY_PROVINCE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KEY_CITY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KEY_ORG&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KEY_EMAIL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions using the default values for all fields &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; when it asks you for common name where you should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client&lt;/code&gt; as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re done, inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/root/easy-rsa/keys/&lt;/code&gt; directory, you should have (amongst others) the following files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ca.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dh2048.pem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;server.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;server.key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ta.key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As root, copy these files to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvpn/&lt;/code&gt;. Copying the client files as well as the server files will allow us to run a client locally to make sure we’ve not done anything catastrophically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mess up the key making process at any point, just run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./clean-all&lt;/code&gt; and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;openvpn-server-configuration&quot;&gt;OpenVPN server configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further you should forward &lt;strong&gt;UDP port 1194&lt;/strong&gt; to the machine you’re going to run the server on. This will vary depending on your router and/or software firewall, I’m sure you know how to forward ports: do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to base our OpenVPN configuration on one of the examples because that sounds like a sensible thing to do. The location of the examples will vary per distro but you want to copy the example called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server.conf&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvnc/&lt;/code&gt;. So on Arch that’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo cp /usr/share/openvpn/examples/server.conf /etc/openvpn/server.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvpn/server.conf&lt;/code&gt; (as root) in your favourite text editor. And edit the settings as follows. I’m only going to include the lines I changed; anything not listed here should stay as default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dev tap0

ca /etc/openvpn/ca.crt
cert /etc/openvpn/server.crt
key /etc/openvpn/server.key

dh /etc/openvpn/dh2048.pem

;server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 # i.e. we comment this line out

server-bridge 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200

client-to-client

duplicate-cn

tls-auth /etc/openvpn/ta.key 0

user nobody
group nobody
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put the full paths in for the key files to allow for flexibility when testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those lines need comments and caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;server-bridge 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… will vary depending on your network. My router assigns IPs in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.x&lt;/code&gt; range. If yours assigns them in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.x&lt;/code&gt; range then you’ll want to change that first value to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.254&lt;/code&gt;. The second value is the netmask which should usually be right as it is and you’ll probably know if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two numbers are the range of IPs OpenVNC will assign to clients. Adjust these as appropriate. So if your router assigns IPs in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.x&lt;/code&gt; then you’ll want this line to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;server-bridge 192.168.0.254 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.100 192.168.0.200
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;client-to-client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… allows clients to ‘see’ each other on the network. For gaming you will most likely want this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;duplicate-cn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… allows multiple clients to connect with the same keys. If you’re going to give each of your clients different keys then you can leave that commented out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. The server configuration is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bridging&quot;&gt;Bridging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create two network devices. The first is the tap0 device that OpenVPN will use and the second is a bridge to connect that tap0 device with our ethernet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do this, I’m using netctl since it seemed simplest. So, as root, create the file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/netctl/tuntap&lt;/code&gt; and put the following in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Description='tuntap connection'
Interface=tap0
Connection=tuntap
Mode='tap'
User='nobody'
Group='nobody'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one’s straightforward. Now let’s make the bridge device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file, again as root, at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/netctl/bridge&lt;/code&gt; and put the following in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Description=&quot;bridge connection&quot;
Interface=br0
Connection=bridge
BindsToInterfaces=(eth0 tap0)
IP=no
ExecUpPost=&quot;ip link set dev br0 address $(cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address); IP=dhcp; ip_set&quot;
ExecDownPre=&quot;IP=dhcp&quot;

# # Ignore (R)STP and immediately activate the bridge
SkipForwardingDelay=yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two instances of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt; there, replace these with the name of your ethernet device which you can find by executing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip link show&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal (it will likely be the one that starts with ‘eth’ or ‘en’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file could be simpler, what this line…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExecUpPost=&quot;ip link set dev br0 address $(cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address); IP=dhcp; ip_set&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… does is ensures that the bridge has the same MAC address as my ethernet interface which was necessary for port forwarding on my router. If this is not necessary for you then there are simpler examples &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bridge_with_netctl&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the bridge done and ready to go. Just the clients left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-config&quot;&gt;Client config&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very similar to the server configuration. First copy the example file to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvpn/&lt;/code&gt; as root like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo cp /usr/share/openvpn/examples/client.conf /etc/openvpn/client.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Again, paths may vary on other distros)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvpn/client.conf&lt;/code&gt; as root in your text editor. As before I’ll only include the lines you should change, everything else should remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dev tap0

remote YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP 1194

user nobody
group nobody

tls-auth ta.key 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one line to adjust here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;remote YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP 1194
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just replace ‘YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP’ with… yeah, your hostname or IP. The one you want your friends to connect to over the internet. So if you’re using dynamic dns and the hostname is hello.noip.com then this line would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;remote hello.noip.com 1194
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using your IP instead which is 1.2.3.4 then the line would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;remote 1.2.3.4 1194
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that’s the client config file done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client.conf&lt;/code&gt; file will need to be renamed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;client.ovpn&lt;/code&gt; so you may as well make a copy now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo cp /etc/openvpn/client.conf /etc/openvpn/client.ovpn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to send your client files to your clients, how you do this is up to you, I made a zip file which I sent to each of them. The files they need are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ca.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.ovpn on Windows &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; client.conf on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ta.key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So bundle those files up into a zip file or whatever you like, we’ll come back to what clients should do with them shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-start-the-server&quot;&gt;Let’s start the server&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we need to bring up the network interfaces that OpenVPN will use, so in a terminal we do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo netctl start tuntap
$ sudo netctl start bridge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we start OpenVPN itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This assumes you called your server configuration file &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;server.conf&lt;/code&gt; like I did. If you called it &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;myserver.conf&lt;/code&gt; instead then this command would be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl start openvpn@myserver&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stop these services just issue the same commands with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;. If you want it so that it all happens automatically at boot then issue the same commands with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it, the server should be running. You can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ip link show&lt;/code&gt; to check those interfaces are there if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/OpenVPN_configs&quot;&gt;Here’s a link to my configs&lt;/a&gt; in case they might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connecting-clients&quot;&gt;Connecting clients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve distributed those client files to your clients as described above and they’re ready to go. Here’s what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-linux&quot;&gt;On Linux&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They just need install OpenVPN  from their repos and put all the files you gave them in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/openvpn/&lt;/code&gt;. Then they can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@client
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they should be connected. Since you already have those files in place you can issue that command to see if it works. It won’t be very meaningful since you’ll just be connecting to a LAN you’re already on. If you want to see whether you’re successfully connected, do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo cat /etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’ll show any connected clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-windows&quot;&gt;On Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows users need to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html&quot;&gt;OpenVPN client&lt;/a&gt;. Once that’s done, they need to navigate to the program’s install directory and then put the files you gave them inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; folder. So their config folder, when things are set up correctly, should contain the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ca.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.crt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;client.ovpn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ta.key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They then need to run the OpenVPN client which will put an icon in their system tray. Then, if things are set up correctly, if they right click on the system tray icon, they should have the option to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/code&gt;, which they should click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should then connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test for a successful connection by getting them to ping an IP on your internal network, such as your own machine, and you can try pinging the IP that OpenVPN assigned to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that works then throw up a LAN game of Hedgewars and see if they can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-stuff&quot;&gt;Further stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;metrics-on-windows&quot;&gt;Metrics on Windows&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows clients may need to mess around with metrics in order to see games. I’m not sure this is necessary; I got my friends to do this before I hit on the working solution. So here it is just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Windows 7 (should be very similar on other Windowses) open the start menu and enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ncpa.cpl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the search box. Press enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Change adapter settings&lt;/code&gt; on the left, this should bring up a list of network interfaces. Choose the OpenVPN one, right click it and select &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the properties window, in the box in the middle, first of all deselect/disable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Internet Protocol Version 6&lt;/code&gt; since this is useless to us for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now highlight the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Internet Protocol Version 4&lt;/code&gt; entry and click on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/code&gt; button lower down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next Window, click on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Advanced&lt;/code&gt; button near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we’re there. Windows instructions are absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so on this window, near the bottom, untick &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Automatic metric&lt;/code&gt; if it’s ticked and then enter &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interface metric&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now OK your way back out of everything. This may need a reboot to take effect, who knows; it’s Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mtu-stuff&quot;&gt;MTU Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to mess around with the MTU size which may or may not improve performance in certain situations. I did it and noticed a minor reduction in pings. I did exactly what &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN# Configure_the_MTU_with_Fragment_and_MSSu&quot;&gt;this section of the wiki&lt;/a&gt; told me to so there’s no point repeating the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cesi-nest-pas-une-lan&quot;&gt;Cesi n’est pas une LAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether LAN is masculine or feminine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said up top, I am not an expert as I hope was evident in my writing. I just stumbled, after a lot of fumbling around, on something that works. If you have any technical questions, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; don’t ask me; I won’t know the answers. Ask some people who might know instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any corrections or improvements to my instructions then please do tell me. Either email me via the link up top or do a pull request on the repo (also up top), whichever you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’d got my config up and running I decided to copy it over to my Raspberry Pi rather than use my desktop PC. That way it’s always available, whether my PC’s on or not. The RPi handles it fine alongside its day-to-day task of being a little media server. It’s a pretty cool thing to do with a Pi you have lying around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uoou/OpenVPN_configs&quot;&gt;here’s a link to my configs&lt;/a&gt; in case they might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, here we are, me and my friends playing Titan Quest by harnessing the vast power of Linux, OpenVPN, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and (in my case) Wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/openvpn_playing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openvpn_playing.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Yeah, we all chose the same gender and tunic colour. How embarassing.&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Snakebird</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Snakebird/"/>
   <updated>2016-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Snakebird</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/&quot;&gt;Snakebird&lt;/a&gt; is an absurdly cute abstract puzzle game. It’s one of the hardest puzzle games I’ve ever played, second only to the how-did-a-human-being-make-this-thing &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/&quot;&gt;SpaceChem&lt;/a&gt;. Snakebird’s difficulty doesn’t derive from complexity — all you can do is move one of up to three snakebirds in one of four directions — it’s about abstract logic and creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it really is preposterously cute. Just look at this little fella:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/image/U8721VM9p9C2v1o6cKJ4qEnGqnE7IoTQgZI-VTdwyTBeimAcIoxXpgK8bPeslY9pPJIvB5IWW2-452kaM8heLSRgleGAo7JKwe94PvV92OD5C1Qm6uNPV2S2SRHWgmWQKrr7lwU0M8AnIBumkZ4a6N1SXp9jVuLgnHhZBg/62fx62f&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could easily mistake the playful aesthetic style as an indication that this is a mobiley, casual game. It’s very much not. The gorgeous artwork, adorable animations (many background elements have sweet little animations when you click on them) and cheerful music belie what is an out and out hardcore abstract puzzle game. They also help dissipate the frustration of being stuck (and I spend a lot of time stuck in this game) — you just can’t be angry at something &lt;em&gt;this cute&lt;/em&gt;. When you dead-end your snakebird up against some spikes it adopts an expression of sheer worry, you can’t help but be amused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/snakebird_sea.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snakebird_sea.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;When you don't remember last night&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snakebird is a pure abstract logic puzzle game. Nothing is hidden, you could solve each level on paper if you so desired. Your objective is to get up to three snakebirds (it varies per level) out of the level by entering a portal. If there is fruit on the level then you must eat it all before entering, doing so makes your snakebird grow in length by one tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no time constraints or moving obstacles, snakebirds move one tile at a time, in the four cardinal directions, when you choose to move them using either keyboard, mouse or controller — I found keyboard the most comfortable; the key bindings are excellent. Snakebirds move like the snakes in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29&quot;&gt;Nokia snake game&lt;/a&gt; with each of their sections following into the position of the previous one when they move, though in a turn based rather than continuous manner. Snakebirds are subject to gravity but if any part of them is resting on a surface (including another snakebird) they won’t fall (unless that surface moves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/snakebird_sky.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snakebird_sky.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Blue snakebird imperiously surveys its domain&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the difficulty arises from what you fail to account for; not noticing that you’ll be dead-ended, not noticing that green snakebird will fall when red snakebird moves and so on. The rest is due to the sheer difficulty of the levels — &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do I get two snakes over &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; spikes? Some of the levels seem impossible, you’ll &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you’re missing something but you just can’t figure out what. And then it clicks and you feel like an idiot and a genius all at the same time. It’s the kind of game you need to go away and think about when you’re stuck; the solution will often come to you when you’re doing something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I was stuck on one level for &lt;em&gt;literally months&lt;/em&gt;. I eventually got it. And then I was stuck on the next level. After a few hours of brain racking I decided to restart the whole game to give me a run-up. I will finish this game one day. I will.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re free to experiment in Snakebird as there’s an unlimited undo function. This isn’t a game about timing or getting everything right in one go, it’s about &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; and nothing else. About using the tools you have to solve the problem in front of you with logic, creativity and lateral thinking. You’re free to experiment; the undo function allows you to work towards the solution one step at a time, you don’t have to solve the whole thing in one go. It’s logic puzzling at its purest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later levels introduce new mechanics such as objects that you need to push around the levels with your snakebirds in order to climb on them to reach objectives. These aren’t gimmicks — they don’t introduce new rules or tools — they’re modifications to or new things to do with the tools you already have. They expand your possibilities, and thus add difficulty, without complicating the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/snakebird_map.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/snakebird_map.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Super Snakio World&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the best puzzle games Snakebird makes you feel stupid at times and smart at others. Sometimes both at once. If you like abstract puzzle games then, well, this is one of the best I’ve played and it’s wrapped in beautiful aesthetics. Even the world map is adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing bad to say about this game. It does exactly what it sets out to and does so with beauty, restraint and taste. Level design is exquisite, I never encountered a level that felt like a re-hash of the problems presented in a previous level — each one felt unique and was a perfect statement of a particular problem. Also it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I rated games numerically this game would score 3 out of 1. But I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snakebird is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://noumenongames.itch.io/snakebird&quot;&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Divinity: Original Sin</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Divinity-Original-Sin/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Divinity-Original-Sin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420/&quot;&gt;Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced edition&lt;/a&gt; is a long game with a stupidly long title that we’ve been waiting for far too long. The devs and publishers, Larian, have treated Linux gamers very poorly over the last couple of years and my goodwill towards them is exhausted. But I’m putting all that aside and looking at the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it really is an &lt;em&gt;excellent game&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party based RPGs like this seem to appeal to two distinct desires: one is for a deep, rich, complex narrative, and the other is for mechanically interesting combat and skills. Divinity leans heavily toward the latter — it’s a game for people who enjoy self-directed exploration and strategic combat in interesting locations against challenging and varied opponents with just enough narrative to keep you moving forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say the writing or narrative are lacking; the game’s world, its mythology and your place within it are well crafted and intriguing. The writing serves the game rather than the game merely being a window into a narrative — if you’re after a Byzantine epic then look elsewhere, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main quests and side quests (of which there are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt;) are often interwoven and overlapping, with seemingly unimportant diversions gaining significance as you investigate them and feeding back into the main story. Side quests in Divinity don’t feel like the disconnected todo-list of chores as all too often they do in RPGs but like small parts of a bigger picture, each of which reveals something about the world around you. Divinity doesn’t over-explain, quests tend not to be explicit “go to X, do Y” instructions, they’re more likely to be “X has happened, go find out what’s going on”, which makes the player feel like they’re discovering and making sense of things for themselves, rather than being led around by the hand and having everything spelled out for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_market.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_market.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Legends say those easels once held valuable paintings&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never found myself really caring about the distinction between main and side quests while playing Divinity, I just did what I found most interesting and the story unfolded naturally. This gives the narrative a very organic feel; not like following pre-defined steps and acting out an already-written play but creating my own story through my actions. It’s an illusion, of course, but it’s an artfully executed one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rivelon&quot;&gt;Rivelon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where Divinity takes place. Divinity’s one of those games that will appeal to people who like to play around with systems. It’s a mechanically complex place where a startling number and variety of objects can be interacted with in various ways. It’s also a world that doesn’t take itself too seriously, at least not all the time. The writers get that medievally-fantasy worlds are inherently &lt;em&gt;a bit ridiculous&lt;/em&gt; and they don’t mind engaging with that. It never descends into tedious wackiness but it is, in the right places, a &lt;em&gt;bit silly&lt;/em&gt;. For example: you might, after picking up a bucket, wonder whether you can wear it on your head. Divinity will let you, it’ll actually be a pretty serviceable helmet, but you will also be blind. That’s ridiculous. But it’s also exactly what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to do in a systemic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightness of the writing is carried over into the mechanics. It doesn’t lampshade things; it doesn’t say “lol you put a bucket on your head”, it just lets you — the wit lies in making it blind you. Similarly the game doesn’t suggest how to play around with the mechanics, you just can. Since you can use combat skills outside of combat you can, if you want, murder everyone in town. If you have a character that can turn invisible then they can do so and steal everything in a shop or house while the owner stands there oblivious. If you have a character that can talk to animals then some animals will give you quests because &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; animals have things they want too (animals in general will offer lovely little bits of commentary on the locations they inhabit). The game doesn’t tell you what you can and can’t do and if you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to do it then generally you will be able to, but it’s up to you to think of it. There’s a remarkable degree of freedom for a modern RPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_hatch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_hatch.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My friend called his cyan-haired warrior 'Mr. Whippy'&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no abstract overworld map in Divinity; it’s one contiguous world made up of very large, open spaces to explore. It’s an as-good-as open-world game with very minimal gating — you’re free to explore the current map in its entirety but you usually can’t get to the next map without getting to a certain point in the main story. The maps really are rather large and any settlements, and the buildings within them, in a particular area are contiguous with their surrounding space rather than separate levels, which really helps to give each map a sense of being a specific place rather than just a backdrop. Only dungeons are separate levels and, like the main maps, they all feel distinct and interesting. There are no generic filler dungeons in this game, every single one feels carefully and thoughtfully designed to convey a very particular mood and distinct character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locations are familiar, certainly — a coastal trading port surrounded by plains and cliffs, a wild woodland, snowy mountains, churches, caves and so on — but a great deal of care was clearly taken in both the level and aesthetic design to make each one feel &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;; the snowy highlands feel &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; and dangerous, they aren’t just the plains painted white. It’s a beautiful game — vibrant and rich without being cartoony — with an art style that renders sunny uplands as cogently as it does dingy occultist shrines while maintaining an absolute overall aesthetic cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that, within these large maps, you can split your party up and send each of them to different places to do different things. This is of particular value when playing co-op since you can get a great deal done quickly in towns by splitting up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you&quot;&gt;You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rivelon there is a magic force called the source. The use of which is called ‘sourcery’. I can’t decide whether that’s genius, idiocy or idiot-genius. At the beginning of the game you will create two characters who are both Source Hunters — an order dedicated to stamping out the use of sourcery by, in an irony that escapes no one including the main characters, using sourcery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can select from a number of pre-defined classes but there aren’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; any classes in Divinity. Your characters have attributes, abilities, skills and perks. Attributes are the usual strength, dexterity, intelligence and so on which dictate how good you’ll be at particular things. Abilities include weapon types, magic schools, talking, crafting, sneaking and the rest. Perks are perks, we all know what perks are. You get a set number of attribute, ability and perk points to spend at character creation and gain more periodically when you level up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_poison.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_poison.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Zombies &amp;amp; pigs: natural allies&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice I missed out skills. This is where it gets interesting. Skills are learnt from skill books, which can be found as loot, bought from traders or crafted. What skills you can learn is dictated by your abilities and these can be mixed and matched freely. So, for example, say I have a character with a point in Aerotheurge (air magic) and one in Man-at-Arms (fighty stuff) then that character can learn, from skill books, 3 novice air magic skills and 3 novice mêlée fighting skills. More points in each would allow me to learn more and higher-level skills. Say that later on I decide it would be cool if this character could summon a spider — no problem, I just drop a point in Geomancy and I can learn 3 earth magic skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of skills and they all tend to be genuinely interesting rather than slight variations on the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This skill system opens up a lot of strategic options. There are, really, no classes — any character can potentially do anything. So the most obvious and primary strategic decision is between being a generalist who can do a bit of everything or a specialist who is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at one thing. There’s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; opportunity for synergies and finding complimentary skills is a lot of fun — particularly since skill book drops are somewhat random. It’s not just about deciding what skills you want but about who does what — do you want one character to be responsible for all the summons or do you want your characters to have one summon each? Do you want a dedicated support character or to have four self-reliant characters? Do you want to build your character around one particular skill in the hope that it drops during this particular playthrough (it may not)? Do you want to spend this next ability point on weapon skills (making you more effective with a particular weapon type) or on opening up more or higher level skills? There are a lot of strategic possibilities before combat has even begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very flexible system that really encourages experimentation. It’s about finding out what works for your characters and how you want to play. It’s an iterative process of continuous adjustments, refinements and redesigns as you find new skills or face new challenges. It also strikes a nice balance between commitment to a decision and freedom to experiment in that you can’t un-spend ability points but you can unlearn skills to make way for trying out others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main characters in my current playthrough are: Drewiepops, a Rogue-Witch who likes turning invisible, stabbing people in the back, leeching their life and generally cursing and hexing them. And Piento, an Air and Water Mage who also uses a claymore. She likes tricking people into thinking she’s a mage so that she can claymore them in half when they get close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_party.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_party.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Piento eschews armour in favour of a lilac dressing gown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pick up companions as you make your way through the game (up to a maximum party size of four) or, a little later on, design your own companions to fill a specific gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;burn-them-all&quot;&gt;Burn them all&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combat in Divinity is just lovely. The varied and flexible skills, interesting and diverse enemies, the tactical importance of positioning and use of terrain and the turn based nature would make for great combat on their own. What pushes things beyond great into exquisite is the elemental anarchy and that systemic approach I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets a little involved so I’ll just spill it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rain spell will cause, as you’d expect, rain. Rain will make puddles in dips in the land or, where they already exist, cause them to expand. Lighting will electrify puddles (of any conductive liquid — blood as well as water), potentially stunning anyone who stands or walks in them. Ice magic will freeze puddles, people who walk on ice are very likely to fall over. Fire will melt ice and cause water to turn to clouds of steam. Steam clouds can be electrified with lightning. Rain also causes anyone caught in it to become wet. Wet people are more susceptible to both freezing and stunning. Earth mages can place down oil which slows people who walk through it. Fire will cause oil to burn. Warm characters are more susceptible to burning. Water puts out fire. Poison, in both liquid or cloud form, will explode when hit with fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enemies with an affinity for a particular element are often healed by that element’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elemental effects are not only for mages, there are elemental arrows and grenades (and water balloons) too. Barrels of various elemental liquids are also scattered around (oil, water and poison) and will burst quite easily when hit, whether intentionally or by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can move (if your character is strong or telekinetic enough) objects such as barrels, crates, bails and so on around in the world to, for example, create barriers in order to funnel enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this all results in, early in the game, is utter chaos. That meadow you started fighting in will look, after the battle, like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. What makes Divinity’s combat great is learning to control the chaos and use it to your advantage. To work out a good way to approach a particular enemy with the tools at hand. To come up with and execute a &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_firey.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_firey.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This was a nature reserve before the fight began&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was playing co-op, large battles would usually be preceded by lengthy strategic discussion wherein we weighed up our various options and tried to select the best from all the many branching possibilities. It doesn’t always go right, of course, it’s complex enough that there’ll often be something you didn’t take into account or simply didn’t know, but coping with that is a good part of the fun. It’s about making a plan and then adjusting it on the fly as things change. Weighing up which character would be best doing which thing, how best to use the party’s resources. It’s extremely enjoyable in single player but in co-op it’s outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat in party RPGs can sometimes be tedious. After a while you’ve learned what the effective skills are and how to position your party, and battles become routine — slight variations on tune. Divinity doesn’t completely avoid this — I think it’s an almost inevitable pitfall of the genre — but it puts it off until much later. For the vast majority of the game no two battles will play out quite alike as the enemies, terrain, your characters’ abilities and the available elemental madness vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;high-praise&quot;&gt;High praise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Divinity. It’s the most enjoyable RPG I’ve played since &lt;a href=&quot;/OpenMW/&quot;&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big, beautiful game. I spent around 200 hours playing the pre-Enhanced version (in Wine). That represents one complete co-op playthrough and one almost complete single player game. I’ve been playing the Enhanced Edition for about 50 hours split fairly equally between separate single player and co-op games. From what I’ve seen so far the Enhanced Edition is an improvement on an already superb game, all of the additions and tweaks so far have been for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/divinity_gate.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/divinity_gate.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I said it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; clear&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like playing with systems, exploring interesting locations in a self-directed way and strategic combat then I can’t recommend this game highly enough, especially if you intend to play in co-op. If you play games like this mainly for the story and want a rich, deep narrative with a labyrinthine plot, reams of lore and character development that occurs explicitly in the game rather than in your imagination then you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; want to look elsewhere. You’d still probably like it though, just not as much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/291650/&quot;&gt;Pillars of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition: The Return of the Philosopher’s Goblet of Fire - Part II: The Wrath of Khan is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_enhanced_edition&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grow Home</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Grow-Home/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Grow-Home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/323320/&quot;&gt;Grow Home&lt;/a&gt; is ostensibly a game about growing a plant in order to get home. And also collecting things. None of that is why you keep playing though, that’s not what it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything, Grow Home reminds me of Just Cause 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just Cause 2 had explosions and guns and vehicles and crashes and terrorism, but none of that, despite what the devs evidently think, is why I played it for hundreds of hours. What Just Cause 2 and Grow Home share is a sense of the joy of motion. Just moving around in the world is blissfully satisfying. It’s about combining the tools you have to move fluidly through a landscape, first becoming proficient and, later, expert. It’s like learning to walk. And then to run. And then to ride a bike. And then to ride a bike &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; and do wheelies and jump over stuff. The freedom of deft motion combined with the joy of dancing like no one’s watching. And we can repeat that learning experience and relive the joy of newfound mobility again and again in games like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-game-about-playing&quot;&gt;A game about playing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bud, the character you play in Grow Home, does move like a child. An over-excited, exuberant, carefree, clumsy child. Animations are procedural and use inverse kinematics, meaning that Bud is always on the verge of falling over in his excitement to change direction and be distracted by something else. It’s almost unbearably adorable and, at first, difficult to control — you’ll do a lot of falling off things early on. Later, you’ll find yourself using Bud’s clumsiness to your advantage, carrying momentum forward into leaps, bounces, rocket-jumps and flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/grow_home_bud.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/grow_home_bud.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The hero of the story&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grow Home could easily be the Rugrats-style fantasy of a child playing in the back yard, having incredible adventures imaginatively fueled by their immediate surroundings — a mound becomes a mountain, a puddle is a lake and next-door’s cat is an angry bull — facing dangers and overcoming adversity. But knowing, really, that they’re perfectly safe — a parent is just inside the house, watching with a smile, suggesting courses of action and probably making sandwiches ready for when the hero of the story realises they’re hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;explorationy&quot;&gt;Explorationy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bud is tasked by MOM — an ever-present AI who is a sort of reverse-GLaDOS; witty, but unerringly supportive rather than vindictive — to grow the star Plant upwards. You’re also asked to scan local flora and fauna, if you want to. I spent a good hour trying to get a sheep to a scanner, grabbing it and skydiving down to a lower island, trying to match my speed with that of the falling sheep to prevent it slipping from my grasp. And it was fun because it felt so physical. This is gaming at its least abstract, a simplified, fantastical version of our own world, and our role as the player is to learn how to interact with stuff physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/grow_home_daisy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/grow_home_daisy.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I grew that&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanners also serve as teleport and respawn locations, allowing you to travel freely between any that you’ve discovered and activated. This makes falling off things less punishing, which is good since you will fall off things. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/grow_home_red.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/grow_home_red.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Beep beep&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really a game about exploration. You begin the game with the ability to climb using left and right triggers (or keys, if you are that way inclined) to grab with Bud’s left and right hands, allowing you to traverse any surface. You’ll start off clumsily but soon become adept. Later you’ll gain access to daisy parachutes, leaf hang-gliders, jet-pack jumps and, if you are very persistent, unrestricted jet-pack flight. Everything about the game is gleeful; from Bud’s clumsy exuberance in motion, which would be frustrating had the devs not made the controls so perfectly exact, to the beautiful low-poly art style, the gently euphoric music and the writing, which never veers into lazy sarcasm but stays warmly witty throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/grow_home_look.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/grow_home_look.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;So much wist&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a thoroughly lovely game. And it’s strange that such a game was made by Ubisoft. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like an indie game with its simple but artfully executed aesthetic and its efficient expression of a small idea. I think we have to accept that ‘indie’ has an alternate definition relating to a series of design choices alongside being a description of a studio’s economic situation. This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an indie game, despite being made by Ubisoft. And that’s &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. But also cool; if AAA studios learn from indie games then so much the better for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing bad to say about this game, it is completely adorable. It is a short game, usually said to be about 5 hours long. I’ve got 19 hours in it in one playthrough and I’m going to dip back into it now and then when I just want to fly and run and jump for the joy of it. If you play Grow Home, I’d urge you to take your time — relax and enjoy it, don’t rush to complete the tasks — just go look at stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grow Home is available for Linux on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/323320/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Victor Vran</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Victor-Vran/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Victor-Vran</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/&quot;&gt;Victor Vran&lt;/a&gt; is an ARPG (the devs have even added “ARPG” to the game’s name on Steam, so you can be sure). As such you will be killing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of spiders and skeletons (some of whom will be wearing bowler hats). This game has so many spiders that it pushed the average leg-count of enemies up to nine. One cave in particular housed such a huge number of spiders that it crashed my co-op partner’s game (this was during early access, don’t worry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To best highlight some of the things Victor Vran does right, I need to outline a few things ARPGs often do wrong…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torchlight was a great game. The skills were fun (they were varied, some were pleasantly overpowered, some were just satisfying) and there were plenty of enemies to kill. That’s all I really ask for in an ARPG; satisfying levelling and lots of enemies. ARPGs are, after all, genocide simulators — you go to creatures’ homes and murder them. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of them. The only real problem with Torchlight (ok it was a bit easy but that’s fine — I could stick on a few podcasts and commit relaxed genocide) was that it wasn’t co-op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I was really looking forward to Torchlight II. A few hours into it though, my friend and I were bored. They’d improved everything about the game &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for the skills and number of enemies. They’d &lt;em&gt;balanced&lt;/em&gt; the skills. They were dull, samey and, worst of all, I had to pump skill points into skills I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want in order to get to the ones I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want, making levelling utterly unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story was great, I’m sure. Probably. If you think I’m playing an ARPG for the story then you’re sorely misunderstanding my approach to the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victor Vran is in many ways the game I wanted Torchlight II to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;story&quot;&gt;Story?!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a game like this I am soldier and Victor Vran understands this. I don’t need explanations or reasons, I just need orders. If I’m in a room full of skeletons &lt;em&gt;I know what to do&lt;/em&gt;, I don’t need a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to massacre skeletons. It’s who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story in Victor Vran — something about murdering lots of spiders and skeletons to support the monarchy — is by no means bad; the bits of it I actually paid attention to were nicely written and rather compelling. But the developers clearly understand that the story in such a game is not my motivation. It is context; it is a description of the state of the world, not my reason for fixing it (by killing lots of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the story out of the way, we can focus on what matters in a game like this: skills and combat. In a shocking departure from the ARPG formula Victor Vran allows you to jump! (you can even wall-jump!) Less shockingly, skills and classes as we know them are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-these-games-are-really-about&quot;&gt;What these games are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; about&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victor Vran takes a leaf from Guild Wars 2 in that your skills are determined by the weapon you are using, each weapon having two activated skills. With a hammer you can do a slam, a scythe allows you to whirlwind, a rapier lets you dash and so on (there are also swords, mortars, shotguns and lightning guns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your choice of outfit (you’re offered a selection at the start and pick more up as the game goes on) is how you paint the broad strokes of your character; how warriory, roguey or magey they will be (there are also some hybrid options). Your outfit dictates, in a very broad sense, your class (much like in real life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/victor_vran_fight.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/victor_vran_fight.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;They had it coming&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you progress through the game you pick up cards and unlock card slots on your character. Cards convey bonuses or passive skills which you can use to focus and fine-tune your character to your liking. This is where you tailor your character to your specific play-style. Do you want to focus on crit chance? Crit damage? Raw damage? Defence? Do you want an explosion that fires off when you crit or when you overkill? There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of cards and their effects are varied and sometimes pleasantly weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cards have levels and your character has a number of destiny points, which increases as the game progresses, and which limits the total combined level of cards you can equip. For example: if you have 4 destiny points and 2 card slots then you can equip 2 level 2 cards, one level 4 card or a 1 and a 3. Straightforward. Except that there are cards that become more powerful the more cards you have equipped. There are other cards which raise your destiny points but do nothing else. It’s a complex and nuanced enough system to more than make up for the lack of a skill tree. Finding a new card — one you’ve not seen before — always leads to a minute or two of careful consideration as to how that card could best be used, what play style it would support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/victor_vran_cards.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/victor_vran_cards.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Plotting murder&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was worried, since you can swap out your outfit, weapons and cards at any time, that there may be a lack of permanence; that the game might be missing that sense of having made a choice and sticking with it, making it work. That’s not the case though — they’ve balanced it right, they’ve just prevented the regret of choosing a skill then being disappointed with it. Changing out a single card won’t have a huge impact since you will have selected them to synergise, you’d have to replace them all in order to fundamentally affect the way your character plays. And that would mean finding another set that work well together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your choice of weapons (you carry two, which you can freely switch between) determines your play style to a large extent - the rapier is inherently mobile, for example, good for getting out of trouble and picking a single target to hit very hard, whereas the hammer is better for dealing with large groups of weak enemies and requires being stationary while attacking. You’re not limited by this though, if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to play a tanky rapier-wielder then you can, you just need to choose the right outfit and find the right weapon and cards (or craft them, there is a crafting system in the game which encompasses all gear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also powers, equippable items (you start out with one power slot) that you gain as you play. Powers do things like rain down meteors on enemies, provide a defensive bubble or generate an aura that improves allies’ attack speed and power. Powers are fueled by overdrive, which is &lt;em&gt;sort of&lt;/em&gt; mana, except that how you get it depends (largely) on your outfit. Some give you overdrive when you’re hit, others when you hit or crit, others provide it at a regular rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all adds up to a hugely flexible system which allows you to get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; specific about how you want to play, and the crafting system smooths out the luck aspect of random drops, allowing you to craft that one card you &lt;em&gt;really need&lt;/em&gt; rather than having to wait for the dice to be kind. This really comes into its own in co-op where, rather than all just bashing on the enemies, you’ll find yourself taking on a very specific role. The big hammer-wielder can take on the mob and protect you while you perforate that one tough fella with your rapier. Or you can all act as diversions until your friend, who’s gone big into overdrive generation, gets enough to fire off their big power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat is based on player dexterity far more than in similar games and positioning is vital. How you need to think about positioning varies depending on the weapon you are using; with the shotgun or rapier you’ll be moving around the outsides, picking your targets and avoiding damage. Whereas with the scythe or hammer you’ll want to be right in the fray, trying to hit multiple enemies at once and dodging around for advantage. Combat is very active and kinetic, there’s no just standing there and whaling on enemies in Victor Vran. If you want to live, you’ll constantly be on the move. Large fights, of which there are plenty, have a frenetic intensity that games like this seldom manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-places-where-you-kill-stuff&quot;&gt;The places where you kill stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game takes place over a series of maps accessed from a central hub. Each map has a (decent) number of dungeons to explore and you can, within a given map, do this at will in a non-linear way or just go to the next main story dungeon and ignore the rest — it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each dungeon and map has a series of optional challenges to perform — find all secrets or kill 70 skeletons within 2 minutes, that kind of thing — the completion of which rewards the player with loot, XP or money. Some of these challenges are &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt; and resulted in a lot of strategic discussion amongst my co-op partners and I. If you complete &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the challenges in the game, you unlock a second level of &lt;em&gt;even harder challenges&lt;/em&gt;. If you enjoy co-op games where there is actual co-operation — where it’s not just a case of doubling the numbers but each person taking on a specific role and working with and around the others — then these challenges are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun. Again, the devs are exhibiting that they understand why I, at least, play games like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/victor_vran_map.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/victor_vran_map.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Satellite imagery of enemy locations&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Locations in the game are varied, expansive and usually rather pretty. Abandoned Victoriany streets and rooftops (I hit one skeleton so hard he landed on the next roof over), the crypts and churches you’d expect, manor houses, open countryside, warehouses, caves and some sort of not-quite-hell other dimension of floating islands. Enemies are equally varied, both in appearance and in terms of how you need to approach them, but tended to be a bit more area-specifc than I’d like. If you’re in a town you’re going to be fighting a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of gargoyles, in a cave it’s going to be pretty much all spiders and so on; but that’s really a failing in ARPGs generally. There are different types of spiders, gargoyles and everything else, it’s never a case of fighting the exact same enemy type for an entire dungeon by any means, and the different types are genuinely different — it’s not just cosmetic, they each need approaching differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/victor_vran_skeletons.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/victor_vran_skeletons.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A target rich environment&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There are also party skeletons. They’re surrounded by disco lights and… they just dance. If you get too close, you dance too. You can’t fight while you’re dancing, not in this game at least. Absurd enough to be funny, especially during a hectic fight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusionicide&quot;&gt;Conclusionicide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs really seem to care about this game, it feels like they made the game &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to play. They listen to the community (perhaps a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much) and there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/games/345180/announcements/&quot;&gt;regular updates&lt;/a&gt; including ‘free DLCs’ (things like daily dungeons and new weapon types).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a perfect game by any means but it does a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more right than it does wrong and, because it does all of the &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; things right, it really scratches that ARPG/dungeon crawler/hack ‘n slash genocidal itch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a superb co-op game to play with friends and one that often requires &lt;em&gt;actual co-operation&lt;/em&gt; and teamwork rather than just a doubling of firepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game plays perfectly well on both controller and keyboard and mouse. I would not normally play a game like this on controller but in this instance it felt better to me. My co-op partner played with mouse and keyboard and was equally happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there are lightsabres in the game. I’ve not found one yet but I’ve seen them in videos. They even make the lightsabre noise when swung, *VZzzeeeeiou*. I really want one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game deserves a lot more attention than I’ve seen it getting. I think the lack of classes and a skill tree might be giving some people the impression that this game is more A than RPG. While it certainly has plenty of A, and the combat is far more about player skill than other ARPGs, I’d argue that it’s no less RPG for it. The weapons/cards/outfit/powers combinations have at least as much depth and flexibility as the class and skill based systems in other games and, since you can usually respec in those games anyway, there’s no less permanence either — it’ll take a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to find and refine that perfect combination of cards and it’s not something you’re going to discard on a whim. This game is firmly ARPG, not an action game with light RPG elements as some may have been led to believe. Moreover, combat is actually &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; thoughtful and strategic, as well as being kinetic and intense, than in other such games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victor Vran is available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/345180&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gog.com/game/victor_vran&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe look out for it in the Winter sales!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>OpenMW (&amp; Morrowind)</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/OpenMW/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/OpenMW</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain type of gamer. They played Morrowind at some impressionable time in their lives and fell in love with it. They spend their time on forums and in chat rooms trying, any time it’s mentioned, to convince people that Morrowind is the greatest game ever made and, importantly, why it’s so much better than Oblivion and Skyrim. They wander like hungry ghosts, &lt;em&gt;craving&lt;/em&gt; an understanding they never see and dying a little more each time someone says “yeah, sure, but the combat was better in Skyrim”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally they meet another like them and feel an immediate bond, a kinship with this person. Until their new friend reveals that they were a member of House Telvanni. Dirty slaver wizard scum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openmw.org/en/&quot;&gt;OpenMW&lt;/a&gt; is an implementation of Morrowind’s engine that allows us to play the greatest game ever made on Linux. It’s an amazing free software project that faithfully recreates the original game while adding in a few conveniences like per-character saves, widescreen support and an FOV slider. Version 0.37 was just released and you should install it right now and play Morrowind; here’s why…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-trip-long-trip-you-decide&quot;&gt;Short trip, long trip, you decide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrowind’s more than a game to me, it’s a place where I spent a good 18 months of my life in the early 00s and have holidayed in, now and then, ever since. I feel more loyalty towards Great House Hlaalu than I do to my actual real-world country. What I’m trying to say is that when you play Morrowind &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; it &lt;em&gt;consumes you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a hostile place. You step off the prison ship in Seyda Neen after telling Jiub your name, you answer a few questions in the Census and Excise office and then you’re cast out into the world with little idea what you’re doing there, why you were released from prison or what to do. If you’ve been paying attention you know that you should talk to Caius Cosades in Balmora, but you don’t know who, where or what that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice the giant flea-thing just outside of town and decide to go see what it is. At this point you notice that your movement speed is sub-glacial, you’ll try to toggle running on then realise it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; on and now you go even slower. You can jump about a centimetre off the ground, doing so exhausts you entirely. You might encounter a rat or maggot on the way to see what the giant flea-thing is and, if you do, it’ll probably kill you. You’ll swing at it with the dagger you stole from the Excise office but after a series of Miss Miss Misses the rat will get the best of you and you’ll die. I hope you quicksaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/openmw_strider.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmw_strider.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The wail of the silt strider means you're nearly home&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on you’ll be running like the wind, leaping over mountains (or flying, if you prefer) and dispatching Dremora and Ascended Sleepers with a single blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spider-web journey between those two points &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Morrowind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;move-along-scum&quot;&gt;Move along, &lt;em&gt;scum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vvardenfell (the island in Morrowind where the game takes place) is the frontier. Imperial law and influence is tenuous and the island is rife with conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three Great Houses - Hlaalu, Redoran and Telvanni - all hate each other (respectfully). The Mages Guild and Theives Guild hate each other. Hlaalu loves the Empire and the Empire Hates Telvanni because they are slavers, as does the Twin Lamps (the slave-freeing organisation). The Mages Guild hates Telvanni (and vice versa) because they are wizards. Similarly Redoran and the Fighters Guild hate each other since they both have a martial bent. Nobody dares hate the Morag Tong, Vvardenfell’s legally sanctioned guild of assassins. The Tribunal Temple and Imperial Cult are at least distrustful of one another, the Tribunal is pretty distrustful of anything Imperial. The four Ashlander Tribes - Ahemmusa, Erabenimsun, Urshilaku and Zainab - hate everyone who’s not an Ashlander (though other Dunmer a little less). The three Vampire Clans - Aundae, Berne and Quarra - hate each other and all non-vampires. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFvIVcobjh8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hates Fargoth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that was hard to follow, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Factions# Reaction_Table&quot;&gt;here’s a handy chart that goes into a bit more detail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason for that big list of factions. Actually, two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to allow me to point out that they are all playable factions with, in most cases, substantial questlines. Making a startling contrast with later games not just in terms of their number but also their depth and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that all of these political and cultural tensions make Morrowind feel alive. More than that, it feels like a place that was living for millennia before, and is largely indifferent to, your arrival. It’s complex, nuanced and cohesive - it all makes sense. Of course all the Ashlanders’ furnishings and tools are made from gourds, beetle shells and chitin - that’s all they have access to. Of course the Dunmer of Vvardenfell have a wary respect for the Ashlanders, who still cling to the old ways and ancient customs, and of course the Ashlanders disdain other Dunmer for turning their backs on true Dunmer culture. Of course everyone eats kwarma (like very large ants) eggs; did you see any cattle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/openmw_ashlanders.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmw_ashlanders.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Under sun and sky, outlander, we greet you warmly&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are entering a living place, not a play put on for you like in later games, you are not the centre of this world. As a now anonymous someone put it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/uikeh/why_was_morrowind_so_much_greater/c4vothb&quot;&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; several years ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Morrowind was a separate world. It did not feel like a playground built for you. Think about how the games start. Five minutes into Oblivion you’re trying to save Patrick Stewart, before you can even control your character in Skyrim a dragon attacks. In Morrowind you walk out of the office with 87 gold and a packet of orders you can ignore. And you really can ignore it, in Skyrim there are dragons flying around and if you want to develop your character’s shout abilities you need to fight them. In Oblivion there are gates spawning everywhere, and if you want the powerful sigil stones you have to go in. The quest system was structured differently as well. If you join the companions in Skyrim you have this magical experience centered around you. The college of winterhold is the same way, and the quest line for the thieves guild could probably be a stand alone game. There’s also the civil war going which, for whatever reason can’t get underway until you arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oblivion and Skyrim bash you over the head with it, LOOK AT HOW GREAT YOU ARE, YOU ARE A MIGHTY WARRIOR FOR EXISTING IN OUR WORLD. The guards’ responses are tailored, the enemies scale, the world is centered around you. Morrowind exists and you are fortunate enough to experience it. Even through the main quest they are pretty clear that you’re not special, just no one else had been able to complete the trials. No one gives a fuck in morrowind, and the adventure isn’t in completing some task that the developers lay out for you, it was in discovering the world. And the fast travel system in the game make you discover the world. The greatest quest I have ever done in any video game ever wasn’t fighting dragons or assaulting hell itself, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Silent_Pilgrimage&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: You exist in morrowind; skyrim and oblivion exist for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quest referred to at the end is part of the Tribunal Temple quest line and involves a silent (you are not allowed to talk to anyone in-game) pilgrimage to a place at the other end of the island. Depending on how fast your character can move, how much they’ve discovered of the travel network and what sort of magic they have access to, this could take &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt;. An hours-long walk, in silent contemplation, from one end of the map to the other. What modern mainstream game would have the courage to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-flatter-me-with-your-attention-outlander&quot;&gt;You flatter me with your attention, outlander&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as being a place to which you go, Morrowind is, through your actions, represented by the interaction of complex, emergent systems. Combat is more numerically complex and involved than in later games with far more weapon choices (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSr3k9ubR7w&amp;amp;t=159&quot;&gt;Spears!&lt;/a&gt;). The magic system consists of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Spell_Effects&quot;&gt;a great many spell effects&lt;/a&gt; that can be combined into spells by the player in endless combinations. Want to make a spell that calms someone, steals their life, summons a skeleton then teleports you to the last place you marked? Fine. Want to enchant that spell onto your trousers? Fine. Want to make it permanent-effect? Fine. Morrowind doesn’t dictate what you should and shouldn’t do, it gives you freedom to find out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to fly everywhere? Fine. Want to jump so high that you will die on landing? Fine. Want to make a spear so powerful that it will kill a god? No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each piece of armour and clothing that you wear (and you can wear &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; at the same time: shoes/boots, trousers, skirt, shirt, left glove/gauntlet, right glove/gauntlet, left pauldron, right pauldron, cuirass, greaves, helmet/hat, robe and a shield) can be enchanted with any spell effect you can fit on it and these spell effects can, with some hard work, be made permanent. This allows for a staggering degree of character customisation beyond what your skills and attributes afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/openmw_pretty.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmw_pretty.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I'm far too pretty for helmets&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The travel system hits that perfect sweet spot between convenience and immersion. You can’t just click on the map to return to a previously-visited location in Morrowind. You’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/w/images/d/dd/MW-creature-Silt_Strider.jpg&quot;&gt;silt striders&lt;/a&gt;, boats, Mages Guilds (they will teleport you, for a fee, between them), possibly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Propylon_Chamber&quot;&gt;Propylon Chambers&lt;/a&gt; in ancient Dunmer strongholds, Almsivi/Divine Intervention (teleports you to the nearest Tribunal temple or Imperial shrine, respectively) and mark &amp;amp; recall (allows you to mark one place at a time and then recall to that place). Any given journey may involve some or all of these methods and you have to keep track of it and decide which to use yourself, the game won’t help you. Journeys, thus, &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like journeys and the game affords you every opportunity to get constructively distracted without making you walk (or fly) everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And getting distracted is half the point. Exploration is a huge part of Morrowind and, unlike in later games, is rewarded. Sometimes with strange, mysterious sights or awesome spectacles (a &lt;del&gt;Viking&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ennbjof's_Nord_Burial&quot;&gt;Nord burial&lt;/a&gt; in the caves deep beneath an otherwise unremarkable tomb, a giant magical fence, a huge meteor suspended above a temple and used as a prison, a city housed inside the carcass of a giant crab) and sometimes with a new weapon or item. And, also unlike later games, that weapon or item is likely to be powerful, valuable or both. It’s common to find something, even at high levels, which you’ll actually want to use or wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-walk-when-you-can-ride&quot;&gt;Why walk, when you can ride?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third member of my little Tribunal, alongside place and system, is narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The narrative of Morrowind is not the story the game tells to you, it is the story you tell using the game&lt;/strong&gt;. This story is woven from your actions, the interplay of the systems you engage with, intersecting with the lore of the game’s world, its culture and the events that transpire as you complete quests. Each interaction will reveal a little more about the world and you’ll fill in your own understanding piece by piece. How thoroughly you engage with this is entirely up to you, you can ignore it completely or you can read any of the game’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Books&quot;&gt;many books&lt;/a&gt; and gain as-complete-as-possible an understanding of the metaphysics, theology and mythology that underpin the game’s narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/openmw_tower.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmw_tower.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Stupid Telvanni houses where stupid Telvanni live&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may come as a shock to players of Bethesda’s later games but the main quest in Morrowind is &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt;. It encompasses events spanning millennia and touches on the nature of divinity and prophecy, the War of the First Council and Battle of Red Mountain, the curse that transformed the Dunmer into the Chimer as they were abandoned by their gods, the creation of new gods through the theft of divine power, the disappearance of the Dwemer and the betrayal (or teaching, if Vivec is to be believed) of Lord Neverar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the nature of Vivec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivec is the most memorable character I’ve ever encountered in a game. Not for what he says or does — all he does during the time in which the game takes place is float in his temple and talk a bit. But for what he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and for his role in events during the preceding centuries. Is he a god? Chimer? Dunmer? Warrior poet? Liar? A hero? Villain? The murderer of Lord Indoril Nerevar? All of those? He is the magic hermaphrodite, the martial axiom and the sex-death of language, that’s for sure. And since this is Morrowind, you can kill him if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Vivec then reached out from the egg all his limbs and features, merging with the simulacrum of his mother, gilled and blended in all the arts of the starwounded East, under water and in fire and in metal and in ash, six times the wise, and he became the union of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite, the martial axiom, the sex-death of language and unique in all the middle world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_8&quot;&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, well I’ve done my best. I can see it in your eyes - you don’t believe me, you don’t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; that Morrowind is the greatest cultural achievement in human history. It’s fine, it’s ok, you’re clearly not the one the prophecies spoke of. I’ll keep looking. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;N’Wah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’ve not even mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:CHIM&quot;&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need the game’s data files to play Morrowind in OpenMW. You can get Morrowind on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and in the usual other places. OpenMW should be in your distro’s repositories, if not you can get it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmw.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s your quest reward for making it to the end:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Game of Armello</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Armello/"/>
   <updated>2015-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Armello</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Armello is a boardgame played on computer, if you can imagine such a thing. It takes place in a fairytale kingdom populated by anthropomorphic animals who compete with each other to become monarch in what seems to be a very unsustainable governmental system. The game encourages both straightforward combative play and devious skulduggery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to usefully describe a game like this; I can tell you that it’s a boardgame-like game which takes place on a hex board with card-based character progression and dice-roll combat, but you could get that information from a screenshot. So how about I play a game and take you through it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice about Armello is that it’s strikingly beautiful. The artwork is sumptuous, from the title screen to the in-game cards with their animated illustrations, the models and textures of the game itself, the pleasing but unobtrusive menu animations — even the loading icon is beautiful. Someone &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; about the artistic direction of this game, and it shows. It’s a warm bath of lovliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://armello.com/wp-content/themes/roots-sass/assets/img/loading.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-path-to-the-throne&quot;&gt;The path to the throne&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve played a few games of Armello. Steam says I have 9 hours in it, but I wouldn’t describe myself as skilled. Or competent. And it’s been a while since I played. I’ll do my best though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_characters.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_characters.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It's always been hard for me not to choose a rabbit with a parasol&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first choice is which of the eight characters to play as. There are 2x rabbits, bears, rats and wolves. I’m tempted to choose one of the rabbits because she’s holding a parasol and rabbits &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; have the best emblem. The rat called Zosha looks very sneaky though, and I do like sneaky. And Sana, one of the bears, is interesting too. I think I’ll go with Zosha the rat, he gets stealth at night and that sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After choosing my character I get a choice of rings and amulets to wear, affording a bit more customisation. These are unlocked as you play a particular species and, since I’ve played a bit, I have a few options. I’ve chosen a ring that gives me scout on settlements at night and an amulet that gives me +1 fight, one of the base stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character stats are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight&lt;/strong&gt;, which determines how many dice you roll in combat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body&lt;/strong&gt;, which is health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wits&lt;/strong&gt;, which determines how many cards you can hold and influences trickery perils&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;, which affects your ability to cast spells and resist spell perils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game I’m asked to choose a quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_quest.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_quest.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I don't know why Doge is offering me quests&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quests are the main mechanic by which your character gets more powerful and gains prestige. You receive a new one each time they’re completed and they tend to involve going to a specific place and undergoing a challenge. I want my rat to be quite fighty so I’m going to choose the one with the +1 fight reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the game starts. The objective of the game is to defeat the king who is, of course, a lion, and to take the throne. There are numerous ways to achieve this, most straightforward being simply to become strong enough to fight him. The king is being slowly corrupted (which is why we’re trying to usurp him, we’re not &lt;em&gt;monsters&lt;/em&gt;) and this corruption will eventually kill him. If no player has claimed the throne by the time the game ends then the one with the highest prestige wins. But that’s not a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the game you are dealt some cards based on your wits. I have 4 wits so I get 4 cards; rats are known for their wit. The cards represent equippable items as well as skills, spells and traps that can be used on the game board or other players. I’ve started with an Oak Spear which gives me +2 swords when defending. That sounds good so I’ll equip that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, it’s time to start! My plan is to be opportunistic. Or maybe that’s my rationalisation for not having a plan. Either way, there’s a settlement just ahead of me and, since you get one gold for each settlement owned every dawn, I think I’ll go capture that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_settlement.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_settlement.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I genuinely love excessive depth of field&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I capture the town by walking over it and then carry on towards the nearby dungeon. I’ve used my three action points and so the turn ends. Night comes with the next turn and that’s good for me since, being a sneaky rat, I’m stealthed at night. I enter the dungeon, failing to notice that someone’s played a peril card on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_peril.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_peril.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I bravely fight with pretend cardboard&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to beat the peril I have to roll my dice and match the three symbols in the middle. This is a spirit peril and my spirit is low so I don’t get many dice. Burning cards with matching symbols also counts. I promptly burn all my cards since they’re rubbish and I want new ones next turn. I survive the peril and am rewarded with 3 gold from the dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-struggle&quot;&gt;The struggle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I carry on towards my current quest objective and stumble into Brun the bear. We were both stealthed, which is why I didn’t spot him, so this ends up as a mutual ambush — ambushed characters can’t use cards during fights. Since I’m much better at combat than Brun I win easily and Brun retreats. I decide to follow and go for the kill since I have a big combat advantage. I kill Brun (he respawns back in his base, which is only a couple of tiles away) and I end the turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_brunfight.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_brunfight.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My bravery knows no bounds as I take on the pacifist bear&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dice roll animation is lovely by the way, all physicsy. Certain symbols on the dice spawn new dice and when this chains it results an explosion of dice bouncing around your screen; it’s very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Brun’s next turn he attacks me and we both die. I respawn back at base and lose one prestige. On my next turn I get new cards to replace those I burned; each turn you are given cards up to your wits value and can choose between items, spells and trickery. I choose all items in the hope of getting some good combat equipment and get a sword which I immediately equip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my next turn I try again to get to my quest objective. I go across the dungeon since it’s the shortest route and the random reward roll ‘rewards’ me with a bane. We kill each other and I go back to my base again. It’s starting to feel like home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have picked up an Allies’ Pact card though. I can play this on another player and we each get +1 prestige per turn until one of us dies. Since we’re both on zero, I think I’ll play this on Brun if I can find him. That might increase my chances of actually getting to my quest location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed my quest! I lost the peril that was on top of it, robbing me of all my magic, but that’s fine as I’m not really using magic. I’m offered a choice of rewards — the basic stat increases OR a riskier option where I get a chance of acquiring a Royal Pardon card or losing 2 health. Things haven’t been going great so I choose the safer option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_reward.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_reward.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;I bravely choose the safe option&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose my next quest, one with a body reward this time since I need to survive fights. The next few turns go &lt;em&gt;surprisingly well&lt;/em&gt;, I acquire a spirit stone (getting four allows you to banish the king and claim the throne) and manage to play the Allies card on Brun. I make my way to my next quest marker. On the way I stumble upon Sana, another bear, and kill her in a mutual ambush. I get one prestige for killing her and she loses one making &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, humble Zosha, prestige leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each dawn the prestige leader gets to enact one of two laws. Unfortunately they’re both bad for me…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_laws.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_laws.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The king is a dick&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The losing an item one is bad as, well, I have items and I don’t want to lose them. The other one is bad because I wanted to heal at a stone circle before attacking the bane who has, annoyingly, decided to sit on my quest objective. I need to heal so I’ll choose the losing an item one, hoping that I don’t lose the really good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, I notice that Mercurio the rat is on that stone circle I wanted to go to so I may as well choose that card. I do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go poorly over the next few turns. I’ve still not managed to get to my second quest and I lost, and then regained, the prestige lead. Sana has enough spirit stones to banish the king and everyone is infected with the rot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot is an interesting mechanic. You get rot by playing certain cards and failing certain challenges. A few rot means that you are infected and you lose one health each dawn. If you have 5 or more rot you are corrupted and the rules change in interesting ways (the rot becomes, if played right, an advantage). If any two characters with rot fight, the character with the higher rot gains their opponent’s rot level in extra dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently only have three rot — not enough to make it an advantage. If I’m going to win this then I need to get my act together and perhaps even adopt a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I’m good at is attacking and, even then, my low health really limits me. I’ve enacted a law that weakens the king and my plan is to complete enough quests to get into the palace and then try a direct assault on the king, working on my combat stats as I go. It’s a long shot but it’s also my only shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_king.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_king.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The king is a slightly weakened dick&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next turn goes well, I use the night to my advantage and ambush Sana, killing her easily, and get within striking distance of my next quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-king-is-a-dick-dead-long-live-the-rats&quot;&gt;The king is &lt;del&gt;a dick&lt;/del&gt; dead, long live the rats!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the very next turn… the king dies of rot and Mercurio wins a prestige victory. Well, at least a fellow rat won. That’s the main thing, right? &lt;em&gt;Right&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/armello_victory.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/armello_victory.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A proud day for ratkind: first &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; second place&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debriefing&quot;&gt;Debriefing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let’s talk about what I did wrong. If I were to sum it up I would say my main mistake was &lt;em&gt;playing very poorly indeed&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what that means in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel, in retrospect, that not having a plan was possibly a mistake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should’ve paid attention to the king’s rot status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t really make use of my night-time advantage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I lost too many fights meaning I had to keep trekking back to where I was&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;didn’t even complete my second quest&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, that might’ve helped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armello’s a great game with a lot of RNG to it and plenty of opportunity for dicking people over — I’ve only played with AI so far and I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; looking forward to playing with humans, there’s nothing quite like backstabbing a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s beautifully presented with a luscious aesthetic style and an attention to fine design detail. It doesn’t feel like a boardgame played on PC, it feels like a boardgame-like game made specifically &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the PC, it feels at home here rather than feeling clunky and compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armello’s available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/290340/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gog.com/game/armello&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If your first reaction to “roguelike city-builder” is “what?” then we’re in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/378720/&quot;&gt;Thea: The Awakening&lt;/a&gt; recently made us a &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/app/378720/discussions/0/490125737485986607/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; Linux version&lt;/a&gt; because they’re not (yet) willing to officially support it. I asked them whether there’s going to be an official Linux release at any point and they were understandably (they’re upfront about their lack of Linux experience) non-committal but they did intimate that they intend to keep updating the Linux version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;until it works as I want it to I cannot promise anything, but for sure there will be updated version for linux reasonably soon if unity 5.3 does proper job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s think of it as an expanded demo for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/games/378720/announcements/detail/38641777217257120&quot;&gt;Thea now has a beta branch for Linux on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roguelike-what&quot;&gt;Roguelike what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs don’t describe the game as a roguelike city-builder but, unless you’re the kind of person who objects to such loose use of ‘roguelike’, it’s the impression you get when looking at it, the easiest way to grapple with an unusual game. And it is somewhat accurate - it’s certainly like a roguelike and it’s undeniably reminiscent of 4X games - but it’s not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thea reminds me most of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/352220/&quot;&gt;King of Dragon Pass&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient indie game from the days before the term ‘indie game’ existed and one I’ve lost many late-nights-that-became-early-mornings to over the decades. Thea shares the same sense of wonder, the randomised narrative encounters, the attachment you develop to your villagers, the sense of real exploration and, of course, the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about exploration in a 4X game it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; somewhat like a roguelike. From the point of view of an individual unit exploring the map they are going into the unknown, uncovering (usually) randomly-generated terrain and potentially facing encounters they may not survive. Thea takes that and makes it the central experience. The numerical abstraction is removed, a band of five explorers is five individual people and you’ll come to care about each of them deeply since they have individual stats and abilities (and lovely portrait images). As you stumble your way from encounter to encounter, the game will help you imbue them each with a personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-city-builder&quot;&gt;One-city builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one city in Thea. It starts as a village of course and mine’s never got beyond what you’d generously describe as a very small town, but I imagine it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; become a city eventually. My current ‘city’ (of seven people) is called Ostoya, so let’s go with that. Ostoya serves as a base for exploration - it’s a place to which my bands of explorers (the game calls them ‘expeditions’) can return to pick up food and resources and also drop off anything interesting they’ve picked up during their adventures. It’s also where new people are born (cabbage fields have a chance of producing children, which is &lt;em&gt;adorable&lt;/em&gt;) and when they come of age I can decide what their profession should be; warrior, worker, crafter and so on - this choice doesn’t limit them, they can take on any role - it just influences that character’s starting stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/thea_cabbage.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thea_cabbage.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Cabbage Patch Kids&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ostoya is also where crafting and building take place. I can build things in my city, just as in a 4X game (only I’m assigning actual people to the task rather than percentages) and with similar benefits. I can also craft things (weapons, food, clothing and armour etc.) which I can give to villagers or expedition members. Each crafted object is individual, if I make a sword and give it to a particular expedition member (who’d have to come back to Ostoya to pick it up) that sword is then carried by that character. A crafted weapon is an individual item not an upgrade, my units don’t all get ‘iron sword’ once I’ve crafted ‘iron sword’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/thea_ostoya.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thea_ostoya.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ostoya? I barely knew 'er&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech tree (it’s more of a web, which I prefer) works as you’d expect, allowing you to craft more objects and build more buildings. On a third tab it also allows you to unlock resources for use which adds an interesting strategic dimension to tech and can make replays feel very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources are gathered (if I assign workers to gather them) from resource nodes near Ostoya, currently I’m just gathering the basic resources of food and wood. More exotic resources are collected by my expeditions during encounters and then delivered to Ostoya where they can be used. Encounters vary from dialogue based narrative choices to combat against a wandering party of spiders. Combat is where an already deeply interesting game gets even more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fight&quot;&gt;Fight!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters have a lot of stats and they each matter for different sorts of encounters. Normal combat uses their attack and defence stats. A stealth encounter uses different stats, but plays out similarly to combat. A ‘sickness’ encounter uses yet different stats. There are many types of encounters and thus all stats &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; matter. Do you make a specialist party, good for only one type of encounter, or do you keep it mixed and try to cover everything? Strategy ensues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/thea_battle.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thea_battle.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Wicker Man&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the type of combat it plays out as a card game with each member of your expedition (or city) represented by a card. You and your opponent, as you might expect, take turns laying down your cards. What I’ve gleaned so far is that, aside from just having the right stats, choosing when and how to play each card is key. I shan’t go into too much detail about the mechanics of combat, it’d read like a manual and the (optional) tutorial does a good job of getting you started, what matters is that it completely hooked me. The combat card game would stand up as an addictive little game in its own right, but in Thea it’s more than that, it’s where you develop an affection for and attachment to your party members. It’s where you learn their strengths and weaknesses. They each end up with distinct personalities and when they die (and they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die), you’ll be devastated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Dobrochna. She’s my favourite. She always seems to be the one who gets me out of difficult situations. The one who snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. When she dies I’ll probably cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/thea_dobrochna.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thea_dobrochna.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The real MVP&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the real joy of Thea. That’s where the seemingly disparate elements that comprise “roguelike city-builder” come together - that sense of attachment and investment in the individuals you’ve helped raise and with whom you’ve shared adventures, narrowly survived tough scrapes and won victories both triumphant and pyrrhic. And the people back in Ostoya, the workers who supplied them with food and firewood, the crafters who made their weapons and the soldiers who defended the city. They all matter individually, they all have personalities, and they’re all working together to survive in a hostile environment. It’s a roguelike with a base of operations and it’s amazing how well that works, how seamlessly it all fits and not only makes sense but amplifies all the things we love about such games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game draws heavily from Slavic mythology and folklore so expect to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusalka&quot;&gt;Rusalki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leshy&quot;&gt;Leshy&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga&quot;&gt;Baba Yaga&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a rich mythology to draw on and the game’s writing and artwork do a great job of bringing it all to life, providing a suitably deep narrative context for such a mechanically intricate game. It’s one of those games where “a quick go” becomes “how is it 6am?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The devs seem to be doing early access right, the game certainly feels mechanically complete and they’re filling in artwork (some looks like placeholder, currently), rebalancing mechanics, refining the UI and so on. The &lt;strong&gt;Linux port is unsupported&lt;/strong&gt; and it does have a few bugs. Keyboard inputs sometimes get stuck for me which is solved by tabbing out and back in which, unfortunately, renders most UI content blank. It’s certainly playable though and I’ve seen worse in official ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving the game away for free until they’re satisfied with the Linux port is a novel approach and one I think the devs should be applauded for. I’m going to buy the game on Steam since I’ve already gotten enough out of it to more than justify the cost (especially as it’s currently on sale) and I want to thank the devs for both making the game available on Linux and being upfront about their intentions. Others might want to wait for an official port and that’s understandable too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-free-go-get-it&quot;&gt;It’s free, go get it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would urge you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D09AAF078EFDC73D!2983&amp;amp;authkey=!AGxe3W4ByFCzWfs&amp;amp;ithint=file%2czip&quot;&gt;download the game&lt;/a&gt; (updates are uploaded to that same url so check back now and then), give it a go and, if you like it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://steamcommunity.com/app/378720/discussions/0/490125737485986607/&quot;&gt;let the devs know&lt;/a&gt; that you enjoyed it on Linux!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hard West</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/Hard-West/"/>
   <updated>2015-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/Hard-West</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been particularly enamoured of wild west settings in games (or anything else) but Hard West’s American frontier with occultism and lovecraftian insanity (or as the game’s Steam description puts it, “supernatural chaos”) drew me in immediately. I was worried that the occultist aspects might be overplayed but, so far at least, the blending is deft. It’s the old West with a darkness bubbling under the surface, hinted at early on by chance encounters with creepy strangers and little eruptions of evil suggesting things are rotten beneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using occultism and existential horror to symbolise the very real but mundane horrors of the old West is a smart move in a game full of smart design choices. They could’ve just made it &lt;em&gt;gritty&lt;/em&gt;, tried to accurately represent the hopelessness and desperation of frontier life, but this fantastical, mythical retelling is so much more emotive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;missions&quot;&gt;Missions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is split over eight campaigns each of which consists of a series of missions making a complete narrative arc. Each campaign has you playing as a different character with minor, though interesting, mechanical changes to how the game plays. I suspect these narrative arcs will converge at some point (this is not a spoiler, I’m only 5 or 6 hours in, I’m just guessing!) and I’m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; looking forward to that happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missions will be familiar to anyone who’s played XCOM or anything in a similar vein, though the game introduces a few smart twists. Action is turn based, you control a group of characters each of which has action points that can be spent on movement or performing actions (shooting, reloading, using skills or consumables), so far so XCOM. Most of the twists are thematic, you can fan your pistols for a series of rapid but inaccurate shots, you can kick things like tables over for cover, you can ricochet your bullets off certain objects to shoot round corners (very cool!) and so on. All lovely additions, giving the game a firmly wild west feel, but not really game-changers. The innovation that makes me want to kiss the dev’s hems is the addition of ‘luck’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hard_west_outside.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hard_west_outside.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The trees look like Morrowind trees&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck is a resource/stat which all characters have (both player and NPC) and which influences that character’s chance of being hit. If a shot misses a particular character their luck is depleted (equal to the percentage chance of the shot), when they are hit their luck refills. What this means in practise is that being unlucky twice in a row is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less likely. Being unlucky three times in a row is virtually impossible. What this means for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; is no more rage, the game feels &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;. No more losing the game because you missed three 90% chance shots in a row, no more losing the game because an NPC hit two 10% shots in a row. You &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; something for missing - it’s no longer all-or-nothing - if you miss you strip your target’s luck so that your next shot is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more likely to hit. I can plan for that! It’s still randomised, but it feels &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genius&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some missions start out as ‘Stealth Missions’ meaning that combat has not yet begun and you can move your team into position before going all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/&quot;&gt;Yul Brynner&lt;/a&gt;. If you get too close to an NPC they’ll get suspicious and eventually start shooting but, in another nice wild western touch, you can brandish your gun and tell them to keep quiet and they’ll obediently put their hands in the air and remain pacified for a given number of turns. Pacifying a roomful of desparados like this with a single character while his team-mates get into position makes me feel like a real cowboy. Yeehaw! Once the shooting starts these missions play just the same as the non-stealth ones but being able to get your pardners into position, to come up with and execute a plan, feels &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and very wild west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission locations are varied, pretty and tactically interesting, nothing feels like filler so far. Skills and weapons are similarly refined, this game doesn’t overwhelm you with barely-indistinguishable options, it gives you a few genuinely distinct choices all of which contribute to the wild-west-gone-to-bedlam feel. I love it when my current character, a mad scientist with four mysterious companions (all called ‘Mr. Persons’), prays during battle and receives 60 luck in return, allowing him to avoid the otherwise-fatal next shot and take down an insane bandit with his six-shooter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hard_west_inside.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hard_west_inside.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Solomon DeLear's Fan Dance&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview-map&quot;&gt;Overview Map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between missions, gameplay takes place on an overview map on which locations are symbolically represented. Each location will provide a bit of interaction - usually a choose-your-own-adventure style bit of narrative, sometimes an extra mission, a trader or a campaign specific mini-game. During the first campaign, for example, there is a prospecting mini-game which allows you to get more money to buy guns and gear. These little vignettes are very well written, sharing the same subtle semantic cleverness as the main narrative, helping to make Hard West’s world a cohesive and engaging place. They seem to be entirely optional, if you just want to get on with the missions then nothing is stopping you from doing that. They’re worth exploring though and I welcomed the quiet time between missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/hard_west_map.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hard_west_map.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;For some reason the player is represented by a cow's skull&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overview map is also where you’ll kit out your posse and access traders and the shared inventory. Besides the guns there are also consumables (tobacco, booze, cocoa, snuff etc. - quite the selection of recreational old West chemicals), clothing and trinkets. Most interesting are the playing cards which drop during narrative encounters and missions. Each member of your posse has five slots for playing cards, each of which confers a specific buff or ability. The clever bit is that if you make a decent poker hand (ace high or better, I believe) then you get an &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; bonus. Unfortunately the cards you get are randomised and don’t seem to persist between campaigns or across playthroughs, it’d be fun to try to collect them all and would add a bit more strategy to the game. I hope this is addressed in a patch at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concerns&quot;&gt;Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linux port is by no means perfect. For me the UI will flicker occasionally which is no big deal, it’s perfectly playable and runs well. Others have it much worse and can’t get beyond the first mission due to a completely broken UI. Hopefully this will be sorted out in future patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two mechanical concerns I see mentioned most often are lack of ‘overwatch’ and no quick save during missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overwatch is a mode during battles whereby you can leave a character in position and they will shoot at any enemy that enters their field of view - in Hard West NPCs have this but the player doesn’t. Lack of overwatch never bothered me, it feels like a military thing rather than a cowboy thing, I feel like wild west gunfights should be chaotic and ad hoc rather than carefully planned and meticulously executed. NPCs not shooting when they see you would feel weird, but I do get that this creates what feels like asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick saving during missions would ruin the game. The addition of the luck mechanic has all but rid this game of those instances where you fail due to a run of bad luck. If you fail a mission, it’s your fault. You did something stupid or your plan was bad and you should learn from that and try to do it better. Allowing saving during missions would make them far too easy and entirely remove any sense of peril or threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers of Hard West have not fallen into the trap, which besets many indie teams (particularly kickstarted projects), of trying to do too much, they’ve kept it tight and focussed. A few minor mis-steps aside, the game is characterised by intelligent design choices and superb artistic direction throughout. The horror aspects are not overplayed - never cartoony - there’s a restrained and sophisticated use of symbolism resulting in a convincing, cohesive and deeply intriguing world that I want to spend more time in and learn more about. The combat is refined rather than oversimplified, boiled down to what really matters and then spiced up with thematic additions and mechanical flourishes (thank you for luck!). The writing, acting and artwork are excellent and, more importantly, feel like they belong together, everything feels part of a cohesive whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s structure looks ideally suited to adding more campaigns. Free ones would be great but I’d be more than willing to pay for more as DLC. I want more stories from this world and, if it’s not obvious, that’s a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosey on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/307670/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gog.com/game/hard_west&quot;&gt;GOG&lt;/a&gt; to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
