    							<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/323320/">Grow Home</a> is ostensibly a game about growing a plant in order to get home. And also collecting things. None of that is why you keep playing though, that’s not what it’s <em>really</em> about.</p>

<p>More than anything, Grow Home reminds me of Just Cause 2.</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/">Victor Vran</a> is an ARPG (the devs have even added “ARPG” to the game’s name on Steam, so you can be sure). As such you will be killing a <em>lot</em> of spiders and skeletons (some of whom will be wearing bowler hats). This game has so many spiders that it pushed the average leg-count of enemies up to nine. One cave in particular housed such a huge number of spiders that it crashed my co-op partner’s game (this was during early access, don’t worry).</p>

<p>To best highlight some of the things Victor Vran does right, I need to outline a few things ARPGs often do wrong…</p>

    							<p>There’s a certain type of gamer. They played Morrowind at some impressionable time in their lives and fell in love with it. They spend their time on forums and in chat rooms trying, any time it’s mentioned, to convince people that Morrowind is the greatest game ever made and, importantly, why it’s so much better than Oblivion and Skyrim. They wander like hungry ghosts, <em>craving</em> an understanding they never see and dying a little more each time someone says “yeah, sure, but the combat was better in Skyrim”.</p>

<p>Occasionally they meet another like them and feel an immediate bond, a kinship with this person. Until their new friend reveals that they were a member of House Telvanni. Dirty slaver wizard scum.</p>

</a>

					
<div class="byline">by <a href="/">uoou</a> on December 02, 2015</div>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>Armello is a boardgame played on computer, if you can imagine such a thing. It takes place in a fairytale kingdom populated by anthropomorphic animals who compete with each other to become monarch in what seems to be a very unsustainable governmental system. The game encourages both straightforward combative play and devious skulduggery.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to usefully describe a game like this; I can tell you that it’s a boardgame-like game which takes place on a hex board with card-based character progression and dice-roll combat, but you could get that information from a screenshot. So how about I play a game and take you through it?</p>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>If your first reaction to “roguelike city-builder” is “what?” then we’re in the same boat.</p>

<p>The devs of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/378720/">Thea: The Awakening</a> recently made us a <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/378720/discussions/0/490125737485986607/"><strong>free</strong> Linux version</a> because they’re not (yet) willing to officially support it. I asked them whether there’s going to be an official Linux release at any point and they were understandably (they’re upfront about their lack of Linux experience) non-committal but they did intimate that they intend to keep updating the Linux version:</p>

</a>

					
<div class="byline">by <a href="/">uoou</a> on November 30, 2015</div>

					<div class="excerpt">
						
    							<p>I’ve never been particularly enamoured of wild west settings in games (or anything else) but Hard West’s American frontier with occultism and lovecraftian insanity (or as the game’s Steam description puts it, “supernatural chaos”) drew me in immediately. I was worried that the occultist aspects might be overplayed but, so far at least, the blending is deft. It’s the old West with a darkness bubbling under the surface, hinted at early on by chance encounters with creepy strangers and little eruptions of evil suggesting things are rotten beneath.</p>
