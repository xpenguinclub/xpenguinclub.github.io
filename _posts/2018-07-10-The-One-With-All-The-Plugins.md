## The Not News! 

* [Godot is getting a 3rd person Shooter 'demo'](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/open-source-game-engine-godot-engine-to-get-an-impressive-third-person-shooter-demo.12072)
* [ANOTHER kickstarter game cancels Linux version](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8wg3ma/stonehearth_kickstarter_linux_port_cancelled/) - reddit comments on this one are interesting to me.
    * [Even PC GAMER commented on this one ](http://www.pcgamer.com/stonehearths-development-will-end-this-month-without-meeting-all-its-kickstarter-goals) 
    * >We have, however, chosen not to pursue the Linux port. We do know that it is possible to make a Wine wrapper that will enable the game to work on Linux, but if this solution does not work for you, and it is the only means by which you can play the game, please reach out to us through Kickstarter and weâ€™ll see what we can do to make amends. (Note - Wine is essentially a software which translates Windows programs on the fly for Linux systems.)
* [Day of the tentacle 2 is coming (its a 'fan' game)](https://catmic.itch.io/return-of-the-tentacle)
* [Stylish extension takes data!](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/) - Extensions are security risks. no exceptions. 
* [Kdenlive new release (finally) coming, new code base!](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/07/kdenlive-video-editor-refactor-available-testing)
